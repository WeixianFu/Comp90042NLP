2,"I 've read a lot about Corona virus lately and I think I should share some highlights of the good read . It 's a #Thread , and in form of Q & A . What is a coronavirus ? Coronavirus is a large family of viruses which may cause illness in animals or humans . In humans , several coronaviruses are known to cause respiratory infections ranging from common cold to MERS & SARS . The most recently discovered coronavirus is COVID - 19 . How does COVID - 19 spread ? People can catch COVID - 19 from others who have the virus . The disease can spread from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth which are spread when a person with COVID - 19 coughs or exhales . Should I worry about COVID - 19 ? Although illness due to COVID - 19 infection is generally mild , especially for children and young adults . It is still quite normal for people to worry about how the COVID - 19 outbreak will affect them and their loved ones . Are antibiotics effective in preventing or treating the COVID - 19 ? No . Antibiotics do not work against viruses , they only work on bacterial infections . COVID - 19 is caused by a virus , so antibiotics do not work . Is there a vaccine , drug or treatment for COVID - 19 ? Not yet . To date , there is no vaccine and no specific antiviral medicine to prevent or treat COVID - 2019 . However , those affected should receive care to relieve symptoms . People with serious illness should be hospitalized . Is COVID - 19 the same as SARS ? No . The virus that causes COVID - 19 and the one that causes Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome ( SARS ) are related to each other genetically , but they are different . SARS is MORE DEADLY but much less infectious than COVID - 19 . Should I wear a mask to protect myself ? Only wear a mask if you are ill with COVID - 19 symptoms ( especially coughing ) or looking after someone who may have COVID - 19 . The mask can only be used once . If you are not ill / looking after someone who is ill then you are WASTING a mask . Can I catch COVID - 19 from my pet ? No . There is no evidence that companion animals or pets such as cats and dogs have been infected or could spread the virus that causes COVID - 19 . Is there anything I should not do ? The following measures ARE NOT effective against COVID - 2019 and can be harmful : 1 . Smoking 2 . Taking traditional herbal remedies 3 . Wearing multiple masks 4 . Taking self-medication such as antibiotics . In any case , if you have fever , cough and difficulty breathing seek medical care early to reduce the risk of developing a more severe infection and be sure to share your recent travel history with your health care provider . #CoronaAlert #coronavirus #CoronaOutbreak #Thread",0,1235238334722699265

114,"Remember : Seasonal flu is * very different * to pandemic flu . If someone says "" Covid - 19 is just like the flu "" , check which one they 're talking about . If they mean "" seasonal flu "" , take what they say with a bucketload of salt . As the name implies , seasonal flu goes round the world every year . We have high rates of immunity to it because many of us have been exposed before , and we even have vaccines to prevent it . Pandemic flu happens just a few times in every century and is much more alarming . 1918 Spanish flu : One of the worst pandemics in history , killed up to 50 million people 1957 Asian flu : Killed at least a million 1968 Hong Kong flu : Killed at least a million 1977 Russian flu : Less than a million deaths 2009 swine flu : Killed several hundred thousand One of those five pandemics , the Russian flu , appears to have been just an old defrosted flu strain from a laboratory . People alive in the 1950s were immune , and the virus was weirdly similar to earlier ones . So really we 're down to four truly novel pandemics . Anyone reading this has almost certainly lived through a pandemic , the H1N1 swine flu in 2009 , but we were lucky there that it was extremely mild with a fatality rate not much different to seasonal flu . Fatality rates often fall as an epidemic spreads but it would be unwise to assume that case fatality in every pandemic will fall to swine flu levels .

With God there is no sitting on the wall @USER Too late for this ... @USER Of course it 's a form of support ! It just should n't have any impact on our political policies . He supported the death row inmate too @USER With that meeting , the Pope sadly undid a great deal of what his visit was . @USER Then exactly how should the meeting be considered ? @USER should n't have met with #KimDavis to begin with . Rewarded bad behavior . @USER Pope Francis may have spoke against Jesus Christ but he is not stupid enough to take a STAND on NONSENSE by the Kentucky Clerk @USER I bet it was more like the pope saying whom is this obnoxious bitch and do I really have to talk to her @USER Funny how someone is inevitably going to spin it to be ... @USER why the hell not @USER Simply stop talking about her @USER @USER 1 of the great things about this pope is he does n't care about appearances . Maybe he was modeling peace & forgiveness @USER but what I heard on news .. it seems it was a form of support .. it was said that the pope told her she had rights like that which is b . s @USER her supporters had the contacts with papal hierarchy to get this set up - those supporters keeping it in the news @USER What is it then ? Does Catholic church support homosexuality ? Does it conduct gay marriages ? @USER so if all the military and police who protected him on his US visit refused to do their job based on religious beliefs is that ok ? @USER then he should n't have met with her ! ! @USER #surelookslikeit @USER thank GOD @USER all of a sudden the memorable visit left a bad taste in my mouth @USER @USER @USER If he does n't care about appearances , why spin the visit ? It was ill conceived and looked terrible for Pope . @USER The face of mental illness being made famous . @USER Who ya gonna believe - me or the pope ? They lyin ! #gaykentucky #refreekimdavis @USER hope he gave her a WTF about being divorced 3 times . @USER @USER . Nor forgiveness ... @USER @USER Why would he meet with her anyway ? You lost me , off my list ! @USER It is perplexing , read an article yesterday , that said Pope was unaware , something to do with vatican politics . @USER @USER that 's right people ! Somebody needs to tell this lady to stop judging ! That 's a sin ! #crazylady @USER ~ did he spank her ? @USER well thank God she met the Pop though it 's Sad the Vatican knows what the Bible says n still do n't provide support for Kim ! Sad sad ! @USER 1 ) Kim Davies is1 of d most courageous human I know.ALONE , she stood PUBLICALLY to defend God 's guide for Mankind 's progress & evolution . @USER Millions of Catholics wait a Lifetime to share a moment with a Pope.Why Her ? Because the Pope is a Socialist who knows Propaganda ! @USER #PopeFrancis is a bullshitter @USER @USER Maybe not but the Pope has a recent history of rejecting an openly gay ambassador from France to the Vatican.Says much @USER Many people "" meet "" with a Pope . Apparently this was a blessing in DC . He probably never heard of her then Wham ! He 's in a storm . @USER So what was it then ? Trying to help the sinner stop homophobing ? A strategy session ? Swapping culture war stories ? An affair ? @USER it 's definitely support . But the Pope is also someone who has done nothing to stop clergy abuse . So who really cares . With how many of God 's gay children did @USER meet ? In secret or public ? Whether supportive or not ? @USER @USER @USER so I assume the catholic religion supports same sex marriage ? @USER important point is that he met with her and not gay groups . Gives quiet support for faithful defending traditional marriage . @USER @USER Terrible to follow Catholic doctrine by a pope , seriously ? @USER Kim Davis makes my skin crawl ! @USER @USER Read the rest of the sentence , not support for ALL of what she is doing . They qualified it . Meaning they support some of it @USER takes a lot of courage to continue being a bigot whilst your country is trying not to be @USER Does n't matter why or what was said . She will put her own spin on it to further her homophobia . Just like they do with abortion issue @USER @USER ( ( saw your status on Facebook the other day ) ) @USER Pope met w / her in support of her religious liberty & conscience to put God 's law above constitution , which he made clear his position . @USER HTTPURL buy this album if you love the pope @USER @USER @USER he met with a gay couple the day before Kim Davis @USER He too ( #Pope ) will stand before God . But wo n't be left standing . Repent of thy ways & turn to God & His Ways . #KimDavis - be encouraged @USER That is a lie and the Vatican did n't say that . Homosexual media lies like homosexuals and lesbians . #kimdavis @USER @USER the people standing against gay marriage are the minority . 46 % is not a silent majority . Less god , more math . @USER I stand with you Kim .. God be with you . @USER I dont understand all this nut hugging for the pope anyway . He is a sham and a douche ... same as all of them .",0,649903655160815616

217,"The most effective way to protect yourself against the new coronavirus is by frequently cleaning your hands with alcohol-based hand rub or washing them with soap and water . HTTPURL The new coronavirus CANNOT be transmitted through mosquito bites . To date there has been no information nor evidence to suggest that the new coronavirus could be transmitted by mosquitoes . To protect yourself , clean your hands frequently with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water . Also , avoid close contact with anyone who is coughing and sneezing . HTTPURL Are hand dryers effective in killing the new coronavirus ? No . Hand dryers are not effective in killing the 2019 - nCoV . To protect yourself against the new coronavirus , you should frequently clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water . Once your hands are cleaned , you should dry them thoroughly by using paper towels or a warm air dryer . HTTPURL Can an ultraviolet disinfection lamp kill the new coronavirus ? UV lamps should not be used to sterilize hands or other areas of skin as UV radiation can cause skin irritation . HTTPURL How effective are thermal scanners in detecting people infected with the new coronavirus ? Thermal scanners are effective in detecting people who have developed a fever ( i . e . have a higher than normal body temperature ) because of infection with the new coronavirus . However , they can not detect people who are infected but are not yet sick with fever . This is because it takes between 2 and 10 days before people who are infected become sick and develop a fever . HTTPURL Can spraying alcohol or chlorine all over your body kill the new coronavirus ? No . Spraying alcohol or chlorine all over your body will not kill viruses that have already entered your body . Spraying such substances can be harmful to clothes or mucous membranes ( i . e . eyes , mouth ) . Be aware that both alcohol and chlorine can be useful to disinfect surfaces , but they need to be used under appropriate recommendations . HTTPURL Do vaccines against pneumonia protect you against the new coronavirus ? No . Vaccines against pneumonia , such as pneumococcal vaccine and Haemophilus influenza type B ( Hib ) vaccine , do not provide protection against the new coronavirus . The virus is so new and different that it needs its own vaccine . Researchers are trying to develop a vaccine against 2019 - nCoV , and WHO is supporting their efforts . Although these vaccines are not effective against 2019 - nCoV , vaccination against respiratory illnesses is highly recommended to protect your health . HTTPURL Can regularly rinsing your nose with saline help prevent infection with the new coronavirus ? No . There is no evidence that regularly rinsing the nose with saline has protected people from infection with the new coronavirus . There is some limited evidence that regularly rinsing nose with saline can help people recover more quickly from the common cold . However , regularly rinsing the nose has not been shown to prevent respiratory infections . HTTPURL Can eating garlic help prevent infection with the new coronavirus ? Garlic is a healthy food that may have some antimicrobial properties . However , there is no evidence from the current outbreak that eating garlic has protected people from the new coronavirus . HTTPURL Does the new coronavirus affect older people , or are younger people also susceptible ? People of all ages can be infected by the new coronavirus ( 2019 - nCoV ) . Older people , and people with pre-existing medical conditions ( such as asthma , diabetes , heart disease ) appear to be more vulnerable to becoming severely ill with the virus . WHO advises people of all ages to take steps to protect themselves from the virus , for example by following good hand hygiene and good respiratory hygiene . HTTPURL Are antibiotics effective in preventing and treating the new coronavirus ? No , antibiotics do not work against viruses , only bacteria . The new coronavirus ( 2019 - nCoV ) is a virus and , therefore , antibiotics should not be used as a means of prevention or treatment . However , if you are hospitalized for the 2019 - nCoV , you may receive antibiotics because bacterial co-infection is possible . HTTPURL Are there any specific medicines to prevent or treat the new coronavirus ? To date , there is no specific medicine recommended to prevent or treat the new coronavirus ( 2019 - nCoV ) . However , those infected with the virus should receive appropriate care to relieve and treat symptoms , and those with severe illness should receive optimized supportive care . Some specific treatments are under investigation , and will be tested through clinical trials . WHO is helping to accelerate research and development efforts with a range or partners .

COVID - 19 is spreading in many countries that do not have 5G mobile networks . COVID - 19 is spread through respiratory droplets when an infected person coughs , sneezes or speaks . Exposing yourself to the sun or to temperatures higher than 25C degrees DOES NOT prevent the coronavirus disease ( COVID - 19 ) You can catch COVID - 19 , no matter how sunny or hot the weather is . Countries with hot weather have reported cases of COVID - 19 . You can recover from the coronavirus disease ( COVID - 19 ) . Catching covid - 19 DOES NOT mean you will have it for life . Most of the people who catch COVID - 19 can recover and eliminate the virus from their bodies . If you catch the disease , make sure you treat your symptoms .

294,"What are the symptoms of COVID - 19 ? The most common symptoms of COVID - 19 are fever , tiredness , and dry cough . Some patients may have aches and pains , nasal congestion , runny nose , sore throat or diarrhea . These symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually . HTTPURL Some people become infected but do n't develop any symptoms and do n't feel unwell . Most people ( about 80 % ) recover from the disease without needing special treatment . Around 1 out of every 6 people who gets COVID - 19 becomes seriously ill and develops difficulty breathing . Can the virus that causes COVID - 19 be transmitted through the air ? Studies to date suggest that the virus that causes COVID - 19 is mainly transmitted through contact with respiratory droplets rather than through the air . Can CoVID - 19 be caught from a person who has no symptoms ? The main way the disease spreads is through respiratory droplets expelled by someone who is coughing . The risk of catching COVID - 19 from someone with no symptoms at all is very low . However , many people with COVID - 19 experience only mild symptoms . This is particularly true at the early stages of the disease . It is therefore possible to catch COVID - 19 from someone who has , for example , just a mild cough and does not feel ill . You can reduce your chances of being infected or spreading COVID - 19 by taking some simple precautions : Regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water . Why ? Washing your hands with soap and water or using alcohol-based hand rub kills viruses that may be on your hands . Maintain at least 1 metre ( 3 feet ) distance between yourself and anyone who is coughing or sneezing . Why ? When someone coughs or sneezes they spray small liquid droplets from their nose or mouth which may contain virus . If you are too close , you can breathe in the droplets , including the COVID - 19 virus if the person coughing has the disease . Avoid touching eyes , nose and mouth . Why ? Hands touch many surfaces and can pick up viruses . Once contaminated , hands can transfer the virus to your eyes , nose or mouth . From there , the virus can enter your body and can make you sick . Make sure you , and the people around you , follow good respiratory hygiene . This means covering your mouth and nose with your bent elbow or tissue when you cough or sneeze . Then dispose of the used tissue immediately . Why ? Droplets spread virus . By following good respiratory hygiene you protect the people around you from viruses such as cold , flu and COVID - 19 . Stay home if you feel unwell . If you have a fever , cough and difficulty breathing , seek medical attention and call in advance . Follow the directions of your local health authority . Why ? National and local authorities will have the most up to date information on the situation in your area . Calling in advance will allow your health care provider to quickly direct you to the right health facility . This will also protect you and help prevent spread of viruses and other infections . Keep up to date on the latest COVID - 19 hotspots ( cities or local areas where COVID - 19 is spreading widely ) . If possible , avoid traveling to places – especially if you are an older person or have + + diabetes , heart or lung disease . Why ? You have a higher chance of catching COVID - 19 in one of these areas .

296,"4 . COVID - 19 is just like the flu SARS-CoV - 2 definitely has flu like symptoms - aches , fever , and cough . both COVID - 19 and flu can also lead to pneumonia . However , COVID - 19 is more dangerous with with a mortality rate between 1 % and 3 % , 10-50 times greater than the seasonal flu 2 . Older people ( > 60 ) and young ( < 14 ) are at risk SARS-CoV - 2 , like other coronaviruses , can infect people of any age . However , ANYONE with preexisting health conditions , like cancer , diabetes , lung infections , immunodeficiency is likely to get affected . 5 .

In fact 80 % face only mild symptoms with no need for hospitalization 6 . Cats and dogs spread coronavirus Currently , very little evidence . However , in Hong Kong , a Pomeranian whose owner had COVID - 19 became infected . The dog did not display any symptoms and this leads to an imp ques to differentiate infection from virus HTTPURL 7 . Face masks protect against coronavirus Disposable face masks may not provide protection . Yes it is better than nothing but most masks dont fit properly , droplets can still enter the mouth and nose . Thus viral particles can also enter . HTTPURL 8 . Hand dryers kill coronavirus Hand dryers DONT KILL . Only soap and water is the best way followed by alcohol based sanitizers to protect oneself 9 . SARS-CoV - 2 is just a mutated form of the common cold All Coronaviruses belong to family of coronoviridae and have surface spike proteins that help them invade host , which can be humans / animals . Covid 19 is thought to be passed from animals / poultry to humans . 9-2 . Thus some infect humans and many infect animals too . The best way to avoid such infections is stop eating meat and follow a more satvik diet . This suggestion may draw flak from others but thats the truth . SARS and MERS were also passed 4m animals to humans . 10 . Antibiotics kill coronavirus Antibiotics only kill bacteria AND NOT viruses . 14 . Thermal scanners can diagnose coronavirus Thermal scanners can detect only fever that can be caused by many reasons COVID - 19 symptoms only 2 – 10 days after infection , and an infection person maybe completely normal to begin with . 15 . Flu and pneumonia vaccines protect against COVID - 19 As SARS-CoV - 2 is different than other viruses , no existing vaccines protect against infection .

I feel this would give us more data and less speculation and patterns could form . @USER realistically , what will it prove ? sure , you can gain data on swf matches versus solo but you will never know which matches those are until theyre over so would it really matter ? what knowledge would be gained that isnt already known ? and what would be gained from said knowledge ? @USER Every match with 4 man swf has a high probability of x . Every match with double swf has x probability ... etc @USER i understand that but you dont know if it 's swf before a match so said knowledge wouldnt make a difference within it . beforehand , it would just be speculation therefore how would it be useful ? you 'd still be playing a match and getting data as you play . 1/2 @USER 2/2 is said data to be used to nerf swf somehow ? to prove what we already know , swf is powerful ? to cast blame on a loss from ? because that is how people would abuse this information . not to mention the additional abuse players would get for playing swf . @USER @USER Hey :beaming_face_with_smiling_eyes: Devs have all the data they want . Showing some extra intel to killers would suddenly decide them to act on SWF ? Also , I do not get how this data could be abused ? @USER @USER In other words , devs have the knowledge they need to make changes therefore why do we need it ? To make a fuss about it ? Killers already send hateful messages ( including death threats even ! ) to survivors they SUSPECT to be swf , the community cant handle that info in short . @USER @USER @USER Simply put , it gives the killer peace of mind knowing that they lost due to something out of their control . @USER @USER @USER It would , yes . But you have to consider the community as a whole . People get death threats for simply playing well . Some people just cant handle that kind of information .

321,"Part 5 Older people , and those with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure , heart problems or diabetes , are more likely to develop serious illness . People with fever , cough and difficulty breathing should seek medical attention . #FREDIBOAT Part 9 Can the virus that causes COVID - 19 be transmitted through the air ? Studies to date suggest that the virus that causes COVID - 19 is mainly transmitted through contact with respiratory droplets rather than through the air . See previous answer on “ How does COVID - 19 spread ? ” Part 10 Can CoVID - 19 be caught from a person who has no symptoms ? The main way the disease spreads is through respiratory droplets expelled by someone who is coughing . The risk of catching COVID - 19 from someone with no symptoms at all is very low . However , #FREDIBOAT Part 11 many people with COVID - 19 experience only mild symptoms . This is particularly true at the early stages of the disease . It is therefore possible to catch COVID - 19 from someone who has , for example , just a mild cough and does not feel ill . #FREDIBOAT Part 12 WHO is assessing ongoing research on the period of transmission of COVID - 19 and will continue to share updated findings . #FREDIBOAT Part 13 Can I catch COVID - 19 from the feces of someone with the disease ? The risk of catching COVID - 19 from the feces of an infected person appears to be low . While initial investigations suggest the virus may be present in feces in some cases , spread through this #FREDIBOAT Part 14 route is not a main feature of the outbreak . WHO is assessing ongoing research on the ways COVID - 19 is spread and will continue to share new findings . #FREDIBOAT Part 15 Because this is a risk , however , it is another reason to clean hands regularly , after using the bathroom and before eating #FREDIBOAT Part 16 What can I do to protect myself and prevent the spread of disease ? Protection measures for everyone Stay aware of the latest information on the COVID - 19 outbreak , available on the WHO website and through your national and local public health authority . #FREDIBOAT Part 17 Many countries around the world have seen cases of COVID - 19 and several have seen outbreaks . Authorities in China and some other countries have succeeded in slowing or stopping their outbreaks . However , the situation is unpredictable so check regularly #FREDIBOAT for the latest news . Part 18 You can reduce your chances of being infected or spreading COVID - 19 by taking some simple precautions : Regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water . Why ? Washing your hands with #FREDIBOAT Part 19 droplets from their nose or mouth which may contain virus . If you are too close , you can breathe in the droplets , including the COVID - 19 virus if the person coughing has the disease . Avoid touching eyes , nose and mouth . Why ? Hands touch many #FREDIBOAT Part 20 surfaces and can pick up viruses . Once contaminated , hands can transfer the virus to your eyes , nose or mouth . From there , the virus can enter your body and can make you sick . Make sure you , and the people around you , follow good respiratory hygiene . #FREDIBOAT Part 21 This means covering your mouth and nose with your bent elbow or tissue when you cough or sneeze . Then dispose of the used tissue immediately . Why ? Droplets spread virus . By following good respiratory hygiene you protect the people around you from viruses such as Part 22 cold , flu and COVID - 19 . Stay home if you feel unwell . If you have a fever , cough and difficulty breathing , seek medical attention and call in advance . Follow the directions of your local health authority . Why ? National and local authorities will #FREDIBOAT Part 23 have the most up to date information on the situation in your area . Calling in advance will allow your health care provider to quickly direct you to the right health facility . This will also protect you and help prevent spread of viruses and other infections . #FREDIBOAT Part 24 Keep up to date on the latest COVID - 19 hotspots ( cities or local areas where COVID - 19 is spreading widely ) . If possible , avoid traveling to places – especially if you are an older person or have diabetes , heart or lung disease . Why ? #FREDIBOAT Part 25 You have a higher chance of catching COVID - 19 in one of these areas . * * * Protection measures for persons who are in or have recently visited ( past 14 days ) areas where COVID - 19 is spreading Follow the guidance outlined above ( Protection measures for #FREDIBOAT Part 26 everyone ) Self-isolate by staying at home if you begin to feel unwell , even with mild symptoms such as headache , low grade fever ( 37.3 C or above ) and slight runny nose , until you recover . If it is essential for you to have someone bring you supplies or #FREDIBOAT Part 27 to go out , e . g . to buy food , then wear a mask to avoid infecting other people . Why ? Avoiding contact with others and visits to medical facilities will allow these facilities to operate more effectively and help protect you and others from possible COVID - 19 #FREDIBOAT Part 28 Why ? Calling in advance will allow your health care provider to quickly direct you to the right health facility . This will also help to prevent possible spread of COVID - 19 and other viruses . #FREDIBOAT Part 29 How likely am I to catch COVID - 19 ? The risk depends on where you are - and more specifically , whether there is a COVID - 19 outbreak unfolding there . For most people in most locations the risk of catching COVID - 19 is still low . However , there are now places around Part 30 the world ( cities or areas ) where the disease is spreading . For people living in , or visiting , these areas the risk of catching COVID - 19 is higher . Governments and health authorities are taking vigorous action every time a new case of COVID - 19 is identified . Be sure to Part 31 comply with any local restrictions on travel , movement or large gatherings . Cooperating with disease control efforts will reduce your risk of catching or spreading COVID - 19 . COVID - 19 outbreaks can be contained and transmission stopped , as has been shown in #FREDIBOAT Part 32 China and some other countries . Unfortunately , new outbreaks can emerge rapidly . It 's important to be aware of the situation where you are or intend to go . WHO publishes daily updates on the COVID - 19 situation worldwide . You can see these at HTTPURL",0,1238879927237304320

333,"I 've read a lot about Corona virus lately and I think I should share some highlights of the good read . It 's a #Thread , and in form of Q & A . Should I worry about COVID - 19 ? Although illness due to COVID - 19 infection is generally mild , especially for children and young adults . It is still quite normal for people to worry about how the COVID - 19 outbreak will affect them and their loved ones . Are antibiotics effective in preventing or treating the COVID - 19 ? No . Antibiotics do not work against viruses , they only work on bacterial infections . COVID - 19 is caused by a virus , so antibiotics do not work . Is there a vaccine , drug or treatment for COVID - 19 ? Not yet . To date , there is no vaccine and no specific antiviral medicine to prevent or treat COVID - 2019 . However , those affected should receive care to relieve symptoms . People with serious illness should be hospitalized . Is COVID - 19 the same as SARS ? No . The virus that causes COVID - 19 and the one that causes Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome ( SARS ) are related to each other genetically , but they are different . SARS is MORE DEADLY but much less infectious than COVID - 19 . Should I wear a mask to protect myself ? Only wear a mask if you are ill with COVID - 19 symptoms ( especially coughing ) or looking after someone who may have COVID - 19 . The mask can only be used once . If you are not ill / looking after someone who is ill then you are WASTING a mask . Can I catch COVID - 19 from my pet ? No . There is no evidence that companion animals or pets such as cats and dogs have been infected or could spread the virus that causes COVID - 19 . Is there anything I should not do ? The following measures ARE NOT effective against COVID - 2019 and can be harmful : 1 . Smoking 2 . Taking traditional herbal remedies 3 . Wearing multiple masks 4 . Taking self-medication such as antibiotics . In any case , if you have fever , cough and difficulty breathing seek medical care early to reduce the risk of developing a more severe infection and be sure to share your recent travel history with your health care provider . #CoronaAlert #coronavirus #CoronaOutbreak #Thread",0,1235238358420516864

345,"What are the symptoms of COVID - 19 ? Symptoms usually start a few days after a person is infected with the virus . But in some people it can take even longer for symptoms to appear . Symptoms can include : ● Fever ● Cough ● Trouble breathing ● Feeling tired ● Muscle aches Most people have mild symptoms . Some people have no symptoms at all . But in other people , COVID - 19 can lead to serious problems like pneumonia , not getting enough oxygen , or even death . This is more common in people who are older or have other health problems . Should I see a doctor or nurse ? If you have a fever , cough , or trouble breathing and might have been exposed to COVID - 19 , call your doctor or nurse . You might have been exposed if either of the following happened within the last 14 days ● You lived in , or traveled to , an area where lots of people have the virus – the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) has information about which areas are affected . This can be found on their website : HTTPURL . You had close contact with a person who has the virus – This generally means being within about 6 feet of the person . If your symptoms are not severe , it is best to call your doctor , nurse , or clinic before you go in . They can tell you what to do and where to go . If you do need to go to the clinic or hospital , you will need to put on a face mask . The staff might also have you wait some place away from other people . The staff might also have you wait some place away from other people . If you are severely ill and need to go to the clinic or hospital right away , you should still call ahead . This way the staff can care for you while taking steps to protect others . Your doctor or nurse will do an exam and ask about your symptoms . They will also ask questions about any recent travel and whether you have been around anyone who might be sick . Will I need tests ? Yes . If your doctor or nurse suspects you have COVID - 19 , they test samples of fluid taken from inside your nose and mouth . They might also do tests on a sample of mucus that you cough up , as well as your urine and stool ( bowel movements ) . Your doctor might also order a chest X-ray to check your lungs . How is COVID - 19 treated ? Most people with COVID - 19 have only mild illness and can rest at home until they get better . If you have more severe illness , you might need to stay in the hospital , possibly in the intensive care unit ( also called the "" ICU "" ) . There is no specific treatment for the infection , but the doctors and nurses in the hospital can monitor and support your breathing and other body functions , and make you as comfortable as possible . You might need extra oxygen to help you breathe easily . If you are having a very hard time breathing , you might need to be put on a ventilator . This is a machine to help you breathe . Can COVID - 19 be prevented ? There are things you can do to reduce your chances of getting COVID - 19 : ● Wash your hands with soap and water often . ● Avoid touching your face with your hands . ● Try to stay away from people who have any symptoms of the infection . ● Some experts recommend avoiding travel to certain countries where there are a lot of cases of COVID - 19 . Experts do not recommend wearing a face mask if you are not sick , unless you are caring for someone who has ( or might have ) COVID - 19 . If someone in your home has COVID - 19 , there are additional things you can do to protect yourself : ● Keep the sick person away from others – The sick person should stay in a separate room and use a separate bathroom if possible . ● Use face masks – The sick person should wear a face mask when they are in the same room as other people . If you are caring for the sick person , you can also protect yourself by wearing a face mask when you are in the room . ● Be extra careful around body fluids – If you will be in contact with the sick person 's blood , mucus , or other body fluids , wear a disposable face mask , gown , and gloves . If any body fluids touch your skin , wash your hands with soap right away . ● Clean often – It 's especially important to clean things that are touched a lot . This includes counters , bedside tables , doorknobs , computers , phones , and bathroom surfaces . ● Wash hands – Wash your hands with soap and water often How can I prepare for a possible COVID - 19 outbreak ? It is hard to predict where future outbreaks might happen . The best thing you can do to stay healthy is to wash your hands regularly , avoid close contact with people who are sick , and stay home if you are sick . If there is an outbreak in your area , schools or businesses might close temporarily . If this happens , or if someone in your family gets sick with COVID - 19 , you might need to stay at home for a period of time . There are things you can do to prepare for this . For example , you might be able to ask your employer if you can work from home , or take time off , if it becomes necessary . You can also make sure you have a way to get in touch with relatives , neighbors , and others in your area . This way you will be able to receive and share information easily . If you or others in your family are anxious about COVID - 19 , keep in mind that most people do not get severely ill or die from it . While it helps to be prepared , and there are things you can do to lower your risk , try not to panic . Where can I go to learn more ? As we learn more about this virus , expert recommendations will continue to change . Check with your doctor or public health official to get the most updated information about how to protect yourself .",0,1236149329074651138

However , those affected should receive care to relieve symptoms . People with serious illness should be hospitalized . Is COVID - 19 the same as SARS ? No . The virus that causes COVID - 19 and the one that causes Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome ( SARS ) are related to each other genetically , but they are different . SARS is MORE DEADLY but much less infectious than COVID - 19 . Should I wear a mask to protect myself ? Only wear a mask if you are ill with COVID - 19 symptoms ( especially coughing ) or looking after someone who may have COVID - 19 . The mask can only be used once . If you are not ill / looking after someone who is ill then you are WASTING a mask . Can I catch COVID - 19 from my pet ? No .

368,"What is a coronavirus ? Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses which may cause illness in animals or humans . In humans , several coronaviruses are known to cause respiratory infections ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome ( MERS ) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome ( SARS ) . The most recently discovered coronavirus causes coronavirus disease COVID - 19 What are the symptoms of COVID - 19 ? The most common symptoms of COVID - 19 are fever , tiredness , and dry cough . Some patients may have aches and pains , nasal congestion , runny nose , sore throat or diarrhea . These symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually . Some people become infected but do n't develop any symptoms and do n't feel unwell . Most people ( about 80 % ) recover from the disease without needing special treatment . Around 1 out of every 6 people who gets COVID - 19 becomes seriously ill and develops difficulty breathing . Older people , and those with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure , heart problems or diabetes , are more likely to develop serious illness . People with fever , cough and difficulty breathing should seek medical attention . How does COVID - 19 spread ? People can catch COVID - 19 from others who have the virus . The disease can spread from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth which are spread when a person with COVID - 19 coughs or exhales . T These droplets land on objects and surfaces around the person . Other people then catch COVID - 19 by touching these objects or surfaces , then touching their eyes , nose or mouth . People can also catch COVID - 19 if they breathe in droplets from a person with COVID - 19 who coughs out or exhales droplets . This is why it is important to stay more than 1 meter ( 3 feet ) away from a person who is sick . WHO is assessing ongoing research on the ways COVID - 19 is spread and will continue to share updated findings .",0,1238410432399933440

Only soap and water is the best way followed by alcohol based sanitizers to protect oneself 6 . Cats and dogs spread coronavirus Currently , very little evidence . However , in Hong Kong , a Pomeranian whose owner had COVID - 19 became infected . The dog did not display any symptoms and this leads to an imp ques to differentiate infection from virus HTTPURL 7 . Face masks protect against coronavirus Disposable face masks may not provide protection . Yes it is better than nothing but most masks dont fit properly , droplets can still enter the mouth and nose . Thus viral particles can also enter . HTTPURL 9 . SARS-CoV - 2 is just a mutated form of the common cold All Coronaviruses belong to family of coronoviridae and have surface spike proteins that help them invade host , which can be humans / animals . Covid 19 is thought to be passed from animals / poultry to humans . 9-2 . Thus some infect humans and many infect animals too . The best way to avoid such infections is stop eating meat and follow a more satvik diet . This suggestion may draw flak from others but thats the truth . SARS and MERS were also passed 4m animals to humans . 10 . Antibiotics kill coronavirus Antibiotics only kill bacteria AND NOT viruses . 14 . Thermal scanners can diagnose coronavirus Thermal scanners can detect only fever that can be caused by many reasons COVID - 19 symptoms only 2 – 10 days after infection , and an infection person maybe completely normal to begin with . 15 .

410,"And that 's why they have always been strong opponents of lockdowns : Tegnell repeatedly said there was no evidence they would work . I mean , what have the lockdowns ever done for us ? HTTPURL And to be fair , in theory it would have been an interesting question to explore back in March : are we sure they help ? But we did not have a EU-sized laboratory nor the time to get data in . We had to act first . All we had is a control group , Sweden , which did not do very well So what is Sweden pursuing , exactly ? The strategy rests on a few pillars . 1 ) lockdowns are wrong 2 ) you are delaying deaths into the future 3 ) we are building herd immunity 4 ) we can spread the virus safely Debunked , one by one 1 ) As the BBC article demonstrates , lockdowns greatly reduced the number of new cases in many countries . They saved lives , they bought us time , they contained potential superspreader events , and more 2 ) If you read the news in Sweden , in March they kept repeating that all the countries that went into lockdown will face a tragic second wave , hence we were doing the right thing by carefully spreading the virus now . Let 's put it that statement to test , shall we ? Denmark and Norway and Finland lifted their restrictions about the same days , let 's use May 11th ( DK and NO ) as the ref . One month ago . How many more deaths have occurred in Scandinavia since our neighbors exited lockdowns ? SW 1493 DK 74 FI 57 NO 22 HTTPURL 3 ) But we are smart , we are building herd immunity ! [ Side note : the argument is so morally repugnant I wo n't even begin to unpack it , as it reeks of social darwinism , but let 's try and keep it aside , albeit difficult to keep aside .

414,"CORONA VIRUS . Thread . 6 . So , how does the disease spread ? People can catch COVID - 19 from others who have the virus . The disease can spread from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth which are spread when a person with COVID - 19 coughs or exhales . 7 . These droplets land on objects and surfaces around the person . Other people then catch COVID - 19 by touching these objects or surfaces , then touching their eyes , nose or mouth . 8 . People can also catch COVID - 19 if they breathe in droplets from a person with COVID - 19 who coughs out or exhales droplets . This is why it is important to stay more than 1 meter ( 3 feet ) away from a person who is sick . 9 . Can the virus that causes COVID - 19 be transmitted through the air ? Studies to date suggest that the virus that causes COVID - 19 is mainly transmitted through contact with respiratory droplets rather than through the air . See previous answer on “ How does COVID - 19 spread ? 10 . Can CoVID - 19 be caught from a person who has no symptoms ? The main way the disease spreads is through respiratory droplets expelled by someone who is coughing . The risk of catching COVID - 19 from someone with no symptoms at all is very low . 11 . However , many people with COVID - 19 experience only mild symptoms . This is particularly true at the early stages of the disease . It is therefore possible to catch COVID - 19 from someone who has , for example , just a mild cough and does not feel ill . 12 . What can I do to protect myself and prevent the spread of disease ? Protection measures for everyone ! Stay aware of the latest information on the COVID - 19 outbreak , available on the WHO website and through your national and local public health authority . 13 . Many countries around the world have seen cases of COVID - 19 and several have seen outbreaks . Authorities in China and some other countries have succeeded in slowing or stopping their outbreaks . 13 . ( A ) However , the situation is unpredictable so check regularly for the latest news . You can reduce your chances of being infected or spreading COVID - 19 by taking some simple precautions : 13 . ( B ) Regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water . Why ? Washing your hands with soap and water or using alcohol-based hand rub kills viruses that may be on your hands . 13 . ( C ) Maintain at least 1 metre ( 3 feet ) distance between yourself and anyone who is coughing or sneezing . Why ? When someone coughs or sneezes they spray small liquid droplets from their nose or mouth which may contain virus . 13 . ( C ) ... If you are too close , you can breathe in the droplets , including the COVID - 19 virus if the person coughing has the disease .",0,1235493800426037248

424,"What are the symptoms of COVID - 19 ? The most common symptoms of COVID - 19 are fever , tiredness , and dry cough . Some patients may have aches and pains , nasal congestion , runny nose , sore throat or diarrhea . These symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually . Some people become infected but do n't develop any symptoms and do n't feel unwell . Most people ( about 80 % ) recover from the disease without needing special treatment . Around 1 out of every 6 people who gets COVID - 19 becomes seriously ill and develops difficulty breathing . Older people , and those with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure , heart problems or diabetes , are more likely to develop serious illness . People with fever , cough and difficulty breathing should seek medical attention .",0,1247075440080150529

429,"Thread about some popular myths on corona virus 1 . Spraying chlorine or alcohol on skin kills viruses in the body Applying alcohol or chlorine to the body can cause more harm . Disinfect surfaces not skin These can not kill viruses within the body ! ! 2 . Older people ( > 60 ) and young ( < 14 ) are at risk SARS-CoV - 2 , like other coronaviruses , can infect people of any age . However , ANYONE with preexisting health conditions , like cancer , diabetes , lung infections , immunodeficiency is likely to get affected . 5 . Everyone with COVID - 19 dies This statement is untrue . As we have mentioned above , COVID - 19 is only fatal for a small percentage of people . In fact 80 % face only mild symptoms with no need for hospitalization 6 . Cats and dogs spread coronavirus Currently , very little evidence . However , in Hong Kong , a Pomeranian whose owner had COVID - 19 became infected . The dog did not display any symptoms and this leads to an imp ques to differentiate infection from virus HTTPURL 7 . Face masks protect against coronavirus Disposable face masks may not provide protection . Yes it is better than nothing but most masks dont fit properly , droplets can still enter the mouth and nose . Thus viral particles can also enter . HTTPURL 8 . Hand dryers kill coronavirus Hand dryers DONT KILL . Only soap and water is the best way followed by alcohol based sanitizers to protect oneself 9 . SARS-CoV - 2 is just a mutated form of the common cold All Coronaviruses belong to family of coronoviridae and have surface spike proteins that help them invade host , which can be humans / animals . Covid 19 is thought to be passed from animals / poultry to humans . 9-2 . Thus some infect humans and many infect animals too . The best way to avoid such infections is stop eating meat and follow a more satvik diet . This suggestion may draw flak from others but thats the truth . SARS and MERS were also passed 4m animals to humans . 10 . Antibiotics kill coronavirus Antibiotics only kill bacteria AND NOT viruses . 14 . Thermal scanners can diagnose coronavirus Thermal scanners can detect only fever that can be caused by many reasons COVID - 19 symptoms only 2 – 10 days after infection , and an infection person maybe completely normal to begin with . 15 . Flu and pneumonia vaccines protect against COVID - 19 As SARS-CoV - 2 is different than other viruses , no existing vaccines protect against infection . So please dont panic , follow the Govt rules of curfew / isolation & eat healthy . Finally dont forget to pray .

Here are some myths that have cropped up so far and facts by the @USER to debunk them . HTTPURL 1 . Is it safe to receive a letter or a package from China ? Yes , it is safe . People receiving packages from China are not at risk of contracting the new coronavirus . From previous analysis , we know coronaviruses do not survive long on objects , such as letters or packages . 3 . How effective are thermal scanners in detecting people infected with the new coronavirus ? Thermal scanners are effective in detecting people who have developed a fever because of infection . However , they can not detect people who are infected but are not yet sick with fever . 4 . Can an ultraviolet disinfection lamp kill the new coronavirus ? UV lamps should not be used to sterilize hands or other areas of skin as UV radiation can cause skin irritation . 7 . Do vaccines against pneumonia protect you against the new coronavirus ? No . Vaccines against pneumonia offer no protection against the new coronavirus . The virus is so new and different that it needs its own vaccine . Researchers are trying to develop one & WHO is in support . 5 . Are hand dryers effective in killing the new coronavirus ? No . Hand dryers are not effective in killing the new coronavirus . To protect yourself against the new coronavirus , you should frequently clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap & water . 6 .

However , it is always a good idea to wash your hands with soap & water after contact with pets . 8 . Does the new coronavirus affect older people , or are younger people also susceptible ? People of all ages can be infected by the new coronavirus but older people & those with pre-existing medical conditions ( such as asthma , diabetes , etc . ) appear to be more vulnerable . WHO advises people of all ages to take steps to protect themselves from the virus , for example by following good hand hygiene and good respiratory hygiene . 9 . Are antibiotics effective in preventing and treating the new coronavirus ? No , antibiotics do not work against viruses , only bacteria . The new coronavirus ( 2019 - nCoV ) is a virus and , therefore , antibiotics should not be used as a means of prevention or treatment . 10 .

However , those infected with the virus are receiving appropriate care to relieve and treat symptoms .",0,1226929068580524034

Yes it is better than nothing but most masks dont fit properly , droplets can still enter the mouth and nose . Thus viral particles can also enter . HTTPURL 8 . Hand dryers kill coronavirus Hand dryers DONT KILL . Only soap and water is the best way followed by alcohol based sanitizers to protect oneself 9 . SARS-CoV - 2 is just a mutated form of the common cold All Coronaviruses belong to family of coronoviridae and have surface spike proteins that help them invade host , which can be humans / animals . Covid 19 is thought to be passed from animals / poultry to humans . 9-2 . Thus some infect humans and many infect animals too . The best way to avoid such infections is stop eating meat and follow a more satvik diet . This suggestion may draw flak from others but thats the truth . SARS and MERS were also passed 4m animals to humans . 10 . Antibiotics kill coronavirus Antibiotics only kill bacteria AND NOT viruses . 14 . Thermal scanners can diagnose coronavirus Thermal scanners can detect only fever that can be caused by many reasons COVID - 19 symptoms only 2 – 10 days after infection , and an infection person maybe completely normal to begin with . 15 . Flu and pneumonia vaccines protect against COVID - 19 As SARS-CoV - 2 is different than other viruses , no existing vaccines protect against infection . So please dont panic , follow the Govt rules of curfew / isolation & eat healthy . Finally dont forget to pray .

Countries with hot weather have had numerous cases . The new coronavirus CANNOT be transmitted through mosquito bites .
