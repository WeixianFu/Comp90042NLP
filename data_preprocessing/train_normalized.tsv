MISCONCEPTIONS 1 . ) COVID - 19 is just like the flu / another strain of the flu . 2 . ) COVID - 19 is not as infectious nor as deadly as the seasonal flu . 3 . ) Younger individuals should not be worried about the virus . Of greater concern to younger individuals , and in fact everyone should be the expected reemergence of COVID - 19 in this coming fall . ( 4 ) The reemergence of infectious diseases in the fall typically is accompanied by mutations to the infectious agent enabling it to infect all individuals , young and old and typically more virulent as well . ( 5 ) Which brings me to point # 4 . 4 . ) The actions mandated by public health officials , schools , and businesses worldwide are by no accounts an overreaction . The prevention of the spread of disease not only helps our health professionals , hospitals , and public health organizations treat individuals , but also decreases risk of mutations in COVID - 19 which would be responsible for a reemergence of COVID - 19 in the fall able to severely affect all individuals as the more COVID - 19 is able to replicate in a host the more likely a beneficial mutation ( from perspective of the virus ) is to arise . ( 6 ) The stopping of the spread of COVID - 19 now is CRUCIAL to preventing the spread later , and for protecting the elderly , immunocompromised , and those with pre-existing conditions . It should also be noted that not extending the course of the COVID - 19 virus in the population disproportionately affects those of lower socioeconomic statuses and those who are more likely to return to their workplace as a result of financial need leading to increased spread . ( 7,8 ) I would never make a claim to be an expert on this topic , and I applaud and look up to those who have spent their lives conducting research on infectious diseases . I am , however , passionate about this particular area of science and passionate about education and educating the general public about infectious diseases . I highly encourage everyone of you to do your research , educate yourself on how you can best help yourself , your family , and your community . The efforts to stop the spread of this disease begin on the individual level and are part of a global effort . The actions of individuals today will have resounding impacts in months and years to come . I urge you to be safe and think of others in addition to yourself .

Being able to hold your breath for 10 seconds or more without coughing or feeling discomfort DOES NOT mean you are free from the coronavirus disease ( COVID - 19 ) or any other lung disease .

Cold weather and snow CANNOT kill the new coronavirus . There is no reason to believe that cold weather can kill the new coronavirus or other diseases . The normal human body temperature remains around 36.5 ° C to 37 ° C , regardless of the external temperature or weather . By doing this you eliminate viruses that may be on your hands and avoid infection that could occur by then touching your eyes , mouth , and nose . HTTPURL The new coronavirus is a respiratory virus which spreads primarily through droplets generated when an infected person coughs or sneezes , or through droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose . To protect yourself , clean your hands frequently with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water . Also , avoid close contact with anyone who is coughing and sneezing . HTTPURL Are hand dryers effective in killing the new coronavirus ? No . Hand dryers are not effective in killing the 2019 - nCoV . To protect yourself against the new coronavirus , you should frequently clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water . Once your hands are cleaned , you should dry them thoroughly by using paper towels or a warm air dryer . HTTPURL Can an ultraviolet disinfection lamp kill the new coronavirus ? UV lamps should not be used to sterilize hands or other areas of skin as UV radiation can cause skin irritation . HTTPURL How effective are thermal scanners in detecting people infected with the new coronavirus ? Thermal scanners are effective in detecting people who have developed a fever ( i . e . have a higher than normal body temperature ) because of infection with the new coronavirus . However , they can not detect people who are infected but are not yet sick with fever . This is because it takes between 2 and 10 days before people who are infected become sick and develop a fever . HTTPURL Can spraying alcohol or chlorine all over your body kill the new coronavirus ? No . Spraying alcohol or chlorine all over your body will not kill viruses that have already entered your body . Spraying such substances can be harmful to clothes or mucous membranes ( i . e . eyes , mouth ) . Be aware that both alcohol and chlorine can be useful to disinfect surfaces , but they need to be used under appropriate recommendations . HTTPURL Do vaccines against pneumonia protect you against the new coronavirus ? No . Vaccines against pneumonia , such as pneumococcal vaccine and Haemophilus influenza type B ( Hib ) vaccine , do not provide protection against the new coronavirus . The virus is so new and different that it needs its own vaccine . Researchers are trying to develop a vaccine against 2019 - nCoV , and WHO is supporting their efforts . Although these vaccines are not effective against 2019 - nCoV , vaccination against respiratory illnesses is highly recommended to protect your health . HTTPURL Can regularly rinsing your nose with saline help prevent infection with the new coronavirus ? No . There is no evidence that regularly rinsing the nose with saline has protected people from infection with the new coronavirus . There is some limited evidence that regularly rinsing nose with saline can help people recover more quickly from the common cold . However , regularly rinsing the nose has not been shown to prevent respiratory infections . HTTPURL Can eating garlic help prevent infection with the new coronavirus ? Garlic is a healthy food that may have some antimicrobial properties . However , there is no evidence from the current outbreak that eating garlic has protected people from the new coronavirus . HTTPURL Does the new coronavirus affect older people , or are younger people also susceptible ? People of all ages can be infected by the new coronavirus ( 2019 - nCoV ) . Older people , and people with pre-existing medical conditions ( such as asthma , diabetes , heart disease ) appear to be more vulnerable to becoming severely ill with the virus . WHO advises people of all ages to take steps to protect themselves from the virus , for example by following good hand hygiene and good respiratory hygiene . HTTPURL Are antibiotics effective in preventing and treating the new coronavirus ? No , antibiotics do not work against viruses , only bacteria . The new coronavirus ( 2019 - nCoV ) is a virus and , therefore , antibiotics should not be used as a means of prevention or treatment . However , if you are hospitalized for the 2019 - nCoV , you may receive antibiotics because bacterial co-infection is possible . HTTPURL Are there any specific medicines to prevent or treat the new coronavirus ? To date , there is no specific medicine recommended to prevent or treat the new coronavirus ( 2019 - nCoV ) . However , those infected with the virus should receive appropriate care to relieve and treat symptoms , and those with severe illness should receive optimized supportive care . Some specific treatments are under investigation , and will be tested through clinical trials . WHO is helping to accelerate research and development efforts with a range or partners .

While initial investigations suggest the virus may be present in feces in some cases , spread through this route is not a main feature of the outbreak . WHO is assessing ongoing research on the ways COVID - 19 is spread and will continue to share new findings . Because this is a risk , however , it is another reason to clean hands regularly , after using the bathroom and before eating . :paw_prints: * Can humans become infected with the COVID - 19 from an animal source ? * Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that are common in animals . Occasionally , people get infected with these viruses which may then spread to other people . For example , SARS-CoV was associated with civet cats and MERS-CoV is transmitted by dromedary camels . Possible animal sources of COVID - 19 have not yet been confirmed . To protect yourself , such as when visiting live animal markets , avoid direct contact with animals and surfaces in contact with animals . Ensure good food safety practices at all times . Handle raw meat , milk or animal organs with care to avoid contamination of uncooked foods and avoid consuming raw or undercooked animal products . :dog_face: * Can I catch COVID - 19 from my pet ? * There is no evidence that a dog , cat or any pet can transmit COVID - 19 . COVID - 19 is mainly spread through droplets produced when an infected person coughs , sneezes or speaks . To protect yourself clean your hands frequently and thoroughly .	0

@USER ... is an issue , but I am not sure the situation warrants the kind of hopelessness and unpredictability conveyed here . @USER To paraphrase Jonathan Haidt , this is the coddled American mind ... @USER The preamble of political opinions about masks , etc . makes me wonder if the hopelessness , as you point out , is intended to make a political point . It seems like a tactic to scare ppl into wearing masks . @USER Yeah those were the elements that made me think that . BTW speaking of your contempt for epidemiologists there is something very interesting going on that they need to get into the bottom off ... @USER NY / NJ / CT continue to trend down in daily new cases even as many other states have either stopped their downward trend or inflected upward since the mass protests started . Estimates of prevalence are 20-25 % , well below the herd immunity threshold . So what is going on ? @USER It is not just mask compliance . I have noticed in NJ increasing socialization and crowding in public places as the state has reopened . Yet we do n't detect a pickup in cases . Could it be that herd immunity can be reached at lower levels than thought or perhaps seroprevalence ... @USER ... estimates are missing true infection attack rates ? It is quite puzzling but I see no attempts to engage with it by epidemiologists .	0

Myths about the Corona Virus 1 . Taking ice cream and other cold foods do not facilitate or aid the onset of the disease . 2 . Taking a hot bath does not prevent the new coronavirus disease . 3 . The new coronavirus CANNOT be transmitted via mosquito bites . HTTPURL 4 . Hand dryers are not effective in killing the 2019 - nCoV . To protect yourself against the new coronavirus , you should frequently clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water . 5 . Thermal scanners are effective in detecting people who have developed a fever ( i . e . have a higher than normal body temperature ) because of infection with the new coronavirus . However , they can not detect people who are infected but are not yet sick with a fever . 5 . Thermal scanners are effective in detecting people who have developed a fever ( i . e . have a higher than normal body temperature ) because of infection with the new coronavirus . However , they can not detect people who are infected but are not yet sick with a fever . This is because it takes between 2 and 10 days before people who are infected become sick and develop a fever . 6 . Spraying alcohol or chlorine all over your body will not kill viruses that have already entered your body . Spraying such substances can be harmful to clothes or mucous membranes ( i . e . eyes , mouth ) . Be aware that both alcohol and chlorine can be useful to disinfect surfaces , but they need to be used under appropriate recommendations . 7 . Antibiotics do not work against viruses , only bacteria . The new coronavirus ( 2019 - nCoV ) is a virus and , therefore , antibiotics should not be used as a means of prevention or treatment . 8 . To date , there is no specific medicine recommended to prevent or treat the new coronavirus ( 2019 - nCoV ) . Some specific treatments are under investigation and will be tested through clinical trials .	0

HOW DOES COVID - 19 SPREAD ? :sneezing_face: People can catch COVID - 19 from others who have the virus . :sweat_droplets: The disease can spread from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth which are spread when a person with COVID - 19 coughs or exhales . :spoon: These droplets land on objects and surfaces around the person . :backhand_index_pointing_left: Other people then catch COVID - 19 by touching these objects or surfaces , then touching their eyes , nose or mouth . :left-right_arrow: People can also catch COVID - 19 if they breathe in droplets from a person with COVID - 19 who coughs out or exhales droplets . This is why it is important to stay more than 1 meter ( 3 feet ) away from a person who is sick . WHO is assessing ongoing research on the ways COVID - 19 is spread and will continue to share updated findings . Can the virus that causes COVID - 19 be transmitted through the air ? Studies to date suggest that the virus that causes COVID - 19 is mainly transmitted through contact with respiratory droplets rather than through the air . Can COVID - 19 be caught from a person who has no symptoms ? The main way the disease spreads is through respiratory droplets expelled by someone who is coughing . The risk of catching COVID - 19 from someone with no symptoms at all is very low . However , many people with COVID - 19 experience only mild symptoms . This is particularly true at the early stages of the disease . It is therefore possible to catch COVID - 19 from someone who has , for example , just a mild cough and does not feel ill . #WHOWhatsapp	0

Part 3 What are the symptoms of COVID - 19 ? The most common symptoms of COVID - 19 are fever , tiredness , and dry cough . Some patients may have aches and pains , nasal congestion , runny nose , sore throat or diarrhea . These symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually . #FREDIBOAT Part 5 Older people , and those with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure , heart problems or diabetes , are more likely to develop serious illness . People with fever , cough and difficulty breathing should seek medical attention . #FREDIBOAT Part 6 How does COVID - 19 spread ? People can catch COVID - 19 from others who have the virus . The disease can spread from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth which are spread when a person with COVID - 19 coughs or exhales . #FREDIBOAT Part 7 These droplets land on objects and surfaces around the person . Other people then catch COVID - 19 by touching these objects or surfaces , then touching their eyes , nose or mouth . People can also catch COVID - 19 if they breathe in droplets from a person with COVID - 19 Part 8 who coughs out or exhales droplets . This is why it is important to stay more than 1 meter ( 3 feet ) away from a person who is sick . WHO is assessing ongoing research on the ways COVID - 19 is spread and will continue to share updated findings . #FREDIBOAT Part 9 Can the virus that causes COVID - 19 be transmitted through the air ? Studies to date suggest that the virus that causes COVID - 19 is mainly transmitted through contact with respiratory droplets rather than through the air . See previous answer on “ How does COVID - 19 spread ? ” Part 10 Can CoVID - 19 be caught from a person who has no symptoms ? The main way the disease spreads is through respiratory droplets expelled by someone who is coughing . The risk of catching COVID - 19 from someone with no symptoms at all is very low . However , #FREDIBOAT Part 11 many people with COVID - 19 experience only mild symptoms . This is particularly true at the early stages of the disease . It is therefore possible to catch COVID - 19 from someone who has , for example , just a mild cough and does not feel ill . #FREDIBOAT Part 12 WHO is assessing ongoing research on the period of transmission of COVID - 19 and will continue to share updated findings . #FREDIBOAT Part 13 Can I catch COVID - 19 from the feces of someone with the disease ? The risk of catching COVID - 19 from the feces of an infected person appears to be low . While initial investigations suggest the virus may be present in feces in some cases , spread through this #FREDIBOAT Part 14 route is not a main feature of the outbreak . WHO is assessing ongoing research on the ways COVID - 19 is spread and will continue to share new findings . #FREDIBOAT Part 15 Because this is a risk , however , it is another reason to clean hands regularly , after using the bathroom and before eating #FREDIBOAT Part 16 What can I do to protect myself and prevent the spread of disease ? Protection measures for everyone Stay aware of the latest information on the COVID - 19 outbreak , available on the WHO website and through your national and local public health authority . #FREDIBOAT Part 17 Many countries around the world have seen cases of COVID - 19 and several have seen outbreaks . Authorities in China and some other countries have succeeded in slowing or stopping their outbreaks . However , the situation is unpredictable so check regularly #FREDIBOAT for the latest news . Part 18 You can reduce your chances of being infected or spreading COVID - 19 by taking some simple precautions : Regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water . Why ? Washing your hands with #FREDIBOAT Part 19 droplets from their nose or mouth which may contain virus . If you are too close , you can breathe in the droplets , including the COVID - 19 virus if the person coughing has the disease . Avoid touching eyes , nose and mouth . Why ? Hands touch many #FREDIBOAT Part 20 surfaces and can pick up viruses . Once contaminated , hands can transfer the virus to your eyes , nose or mouth . From there , the virus can enter your body and can make you sick . Make sure you , and the people around you , follow good respiratory hygiene . #FREDIBOAT Part 21 This means covering your mouth and nose with your bent elbow or tissue when you cough or sneeze . Then dispose of the used tissue immediately . Why ? Droplets spread virus . By following good respiratory hygiene you protect the people around you from viruses such as Part 22 cold , flu and COVID - 19 . Stay home if you feel unwell . If you have a fever , cough and difficulty breathing , seek medical attention and call in advance . Follow the directions of your local health authority . Why ? National and local authorities will #FREDIBOAT Part 23 have the most up to date information on the situation in your area . Calling in advance will allow your health care provider to quickly direct you to the right health facility . This will also protect you and help prevent spread of viruses and other infections . #FREDIBOAT Part 24 Keep up to date on the latest COVID - 19 hotspots ( cities or local areas where COVID - 19 is spreading widely ) . If possible , avoid traveling to places – especially if you are an older person or have diabetes , heart or lung disease . Why ? #FREDIBOAT Part 25 You have a higher chance of catching COVID - 19 in one of these areas . * * * Protection measures for persons who are in or have recently visited ( past 14 days ) areas where COVID - 19 is spreading Follow the guidance outlined above ( Protection measures for #FREDIBOAT Part 26 everyone ) Self-isolate by staying at home if you begin to feel unwell , even with mild symptoms such as headache , low grade fever ( 37.3 C or above ) and slight runny nose , until you recover . If it is essential for you to have someone bring you supplies or #FREDIBOAT Part 27 to go out , e . g . to buy food , then wear a mask to avoid infecting other people . Why ? Avoiding contact with others and visits to medical facilities will allow these facilities to operate more effectively and help protect you and others from possible COVID - 19 #FREDIBOAT Part 28 Why ? Calling in advance will allow your health care provider to quickly direct you to the right health facility . This will also help to prevent possible spread of COVID - 19 and other viruses . #FREDIBOAT Part 29 How likely am I to catch COVID - 19 ? The risk depends on where you are - and more specifically , whether there is a COVID - 19 outbreak unfolding there . For most people in most locations the risk of catching COVID - 19 is still low . However , there are now places around Part 30 the world ( cities or areas ) where the disease is spreading . For people living in , or visiting , these areas the risk of catching COVID - 19 is higher . Governments and health authorities are taking vigorous action every time a new case of COVID - 19 is identified . Be sure to Part 31 comply with any local restrictions on travel , movement or large gatherings . Cooperating with disease control efforts will reduce your risk of catching or spreading COVID - 19 . COVID - 19 outbreaks can be contained and transmission stopped , as has been shown in #FREDIBOAT Part 32 China and some other countries . Unfortunately , new outbreaks can emerge rapidly . It 's important to be aware of the situation where you are or intend to go . WHO publishes daily updates on the COVID - 19 situation worldwide . You can see these at HTTPURL	0

What are the symptoms of COVID - 19 ? The most common symptoms of COVID - 19 are fever , tiredness , and dry cough . Some patients may have aches and pains , nasal congestion , runny nose , sore throat or diarrhea . These symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually . HTTPURL How does COVID - 19 spread ? People can catch COVID - 19 from others who have the virus . The disease can spread from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth which are spread when a person with COVID - 19 coughs or exhales . Some people become infected but do n't develop any symptoms and do n't feel unwell . Most people ( about 80 % ) recover from the disease without needing special treatment . Around 1 out of every 6 people who gets COVID - 19 becomes seriously ill and develops difficulty breathing . Older people , and those with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure , heart problems or diabetes , are more likely to develop serious illness . People with fever , cough and difficulty breathing should seek medical attention . These droplets land on objects and surfaces around the person . Other people then catch COVID - 19 by touching these objects or surfaces , then touching their eyes , nose or mouth . People can also catch COVID - 19 if they breathe in droplets from a person with + + COVID - 19 who coughs out or exhales droplets . This is why it is important to stay more than 1 meter ( 3 feet ) away from a person who is sick . Can the virus that causes COVID - 19 be transmitted through the air ? Studies to date suggest that the virus that causes COVID - 19 is mainly transmitted through contact with respiratory droplets rather than through the air . Can CoVID - 19 be caught from a person who has no symptoms ? The main way the disease spreads is through respiratory droplets expelled by someone who is coughing . The risk of catching COVID - 19 from someone with no symptoms at all is very low . However , many people with COVID - 19 experience only mild symptoms . This is particularly true at the early stages of the disease . It is therefore possible to catch COVID - 19 from someone who has , for example , just a mild cough and does not feel ill . You can reduce your chances of being infected or spreading COVID - 19 by taking some simple precautions : Regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water . Why ? Washing your hands with soap and water or using alcohol-based hand rub kills viruses that may be on your hands . Maintain at least 1 metre ( 3 feet ) distance between yourself and anyone who is coughing or sneezing . Why ? When someone coughs or sneezes they spray small liquid droplets from their nose or mouth which may contain virus . If you are too close , you can breathe in the droplets , including the COVID - 19 virus if the person coughing has the disease . Avoid touching eyes , nose and mouth . Why ? Hands touch many surfaces and can pick up viruses . Once contaminated , hands can transfer the virus to your eyes , nose or mouth . From there , the virus can enter your body and can make you sick . Make sure you , and the people around you , follow good respiratory hygiene . This means covering your mouth and nose with your bent elbow or tissue when you cough or sneeze . Then dispose of the used tissue immediately . Why ? Droplets spread virus . By following good respiratory hygiene you protect the people around you from viruses such as cold , flu and COVID - 19 . Stay home if you feel unwell . If you have a fever , cough and difficulty breathing , seek medical attention and call in advance . Follow the directions of your local health authority . Why ? National and local authorities will have the most up to date information on the situation in your area . Calling in advance will allow your health care provider to quickly direct you to the right health facility . This will also protect you and help prevent spread of viruses and other infections . Keep up to date on the latest COVID - 19 hotspots ( cities or local areas where COVID - 19 is spreading widely ) . If possible , avoid traveling to places – especially if you are an older person or have + + diabetes , heart or lung disease . Why ? You have a higher chance of catching COVID - 19 in one of these areas .

As of today , 169,906 Covid - 19 cases have been confirmed , resulting in 6,644 fatalities worldwide . After its discovery last December , in Wuhan , China , the virus started to spread around the world , causing panic . How do the seven human coronaviruses differ ? The main difference lies in the severity of the illnesses they cause . The first four respiratory viruses range from mild to medium , while Sars and Mers can cause respiratory illness of high severity . How do viruses work ? A virus is a protein box with genetic material inside which needs a living cell to replicate . It enters the cell through binding with receptors and “ reprogrammes it ” to make copies of itself , working as a template to replicate more viruses inside the body . How does Covid - 19 spread ? At the moment , we know that the virus is transmitted through contaminated droplets . Droplets of saliva or mucus carrying the respiratory virus can travel one to three metres through coughing or sneezing . The virus needs to fully enter the respiratory tract for infection to happen , but that 's why the risk of infection can be reduced by avoiding close contact with sick people . Washing your hands thoroughly greatly reduces the risk of infection . There are reports that infection is possible through faeces and recirculated air ventilation systems and air conditioners . But this has not been systematically studied , so it is hard to say with 100 per cent certainty . How deadly is the new coronavirus compared to Sars , Mers and the four coronaviruses that cause the common cold ? We can not determine this for certain as the apparent mortality rate is likely to be overestimated at the start of an outbreak , because a lot of mild cases are missed . Also , with Covid - 19 , some people can be asymptomatic - meaning the virus is not always detected and therefore not recorded . The mortality rate for influenza is 0.1 per cent , but since Covid - 19 is so new it remains to be seen just how many cases will turn out to be fatal . It is commonly cited that in a given year with no complications , influenza kills 500,000 people . Compared to the four respiratory coronaviruses , the mortality rate for Sars-Cov - 2 is higher . Although compared to Sars ( 9.6 per cent ) and Mers ( 34.4 per cent ) , Covid - 19 shows a low mortality rate but with a wider spread , making the total number of deaths larger . Can summer , or warmer temperatures help eradicate the virus ? For some respiratory viruses this does happen . Not because of the temperature , but also thanks to the humidity and changes in social patterns of human beings . In this case , it is still premature to say .	0

When this pandemic infected 26 of the population worldwide , it made me fear for my life . But now ? It infected more than a hundred thousands of people , millions of people to be exact . What is “ COVID - 19 ” anyway ? It is a crisis that we all should take seriously . HTTPURL This pandemic , I became productive . I learned how to decipher codes , I get to watch a lot of animes and read many books . I am happy because I get to spend more time with my family like , watching movies , eating together and talked and talked about everything . This pandemic started and the true face of the people also started to unmask . Some families does n't have a proper home , some does n't have the stable job to provide the need for their family , and some does n't have the privilege to protect themselves during this pandemic . What about them ? There are people that are hoarding the necessities , to what ? To benefit you from preventing the virus ? To re-sell it at a higher price ? These people did n't even think about the people who does n't have enough money to buy enough necessities for their family . HTTPURL To be honest , I got mad at them . During this pandemic , I also realized how bad our government is . The president did n't even bother to tell us the plan at an early time , instead he ordered the police and soldiers to kill everyone not obeying the rules . I mean ? ? ? HTTPURL The people not obeying the rules are hungry , they are waiting for the relief goods that was supposed to be distributed as soon as possible but nothing was distributed . HTTPURL I also realized that no matter how bad and irresponsible you are , if you have a position at the government and if you are rich , you can wander freely everywhere , spreading the virus and still be given compassion that you do n't deserve . HTTPURL This pandemic made me aware of the issues of what 's really happening . It angers me a lot , to be honest because if you do n't have the privilege , you are going to be ignored like a pest . That 's how dirty the government works . We already have the highest number of COVID - 19 cases in Southeast Asia with minimal testing . Without testing , we 're acting blind & exposing the vulnerable — old , poor , and the jobless . I think that there will be no choice but to extend this lockdown . HTTPURL We should all cooperate during this lockdown . The government should provide our needs and necessities to prevent people from going outside . We can overcome this situation by cooperating and puting our faith to God and the frontliners . HTTPURL We also should give our biggest salute to our frontliners , not only they are giving their absolute best , but they are staking their lives as well . HTTPURL REINE ELYSSA G .

@USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER Agree Meredith . But when herd immunity takes over , it will have fewer hosts . My belief is that immunity from a real infection is greater than that achieved from a vaccine . COVID is so contagious that herd will occur prior to a vaccine . @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER What is it for normal flu ? Guessing it 's pretty high . Given the extremely low average mortality rate for COVID - 19 I 'd expect the NNT to be over 10,000 , maybe much higher once herd immunity is reached worldwide . Residual panic will no doubt help with sales .	0

Just want to not only rely on Whatsapp msgs and Facebook posts ( that are 90 % fake ) 4/7 As a responsible nation , every field should participate and do their best to overcome this pandemic situation , HEC should advise all the universities to conduct lectures on coronavirus from respective experts , and should sum up these lectures in the form of course 5/7 #COVIDー19 What is #coronavirus , its pathophysiology ? Why social distancing is important ? A diet that boost immunity etc so we students ( regardless of our field ) could be able to counsel their parents , relatives , friends , and workers 6/7 #COVIDー19 This is all how we can contribute as a student for the betterment of Pakistan May Allah bless our country :red_heart: :red_heart: Aameen ! ! #COVIDー19	0

Let ´ s help fight the spread of the coronavirus . Let ´ s protect ourselves , our loved ones , colleagues , friends , the community and our country . So here ´ s a thread of Q & A on coronaviruses ( COVID - 19 ) from World Health Organization . #CovidfreeApril #CovidfreePhilippines #CovidfreeWorld What is a coronavirus ? Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses which may cause illness in animals or humans . In humans , several coronaviruses are known to cause respiratory infections ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as MERS , SARS and now , COVID - 19 . What is COVID - 19 ? COVID - 19 is the infectious disease caused by the most recently discovered coronavirus . This new virus and disease were unknown before the outbreak began in Wuhan , China , in December 2019 . What are the symptoms of COVID - 19 ? The most common symptoms of COVID - 19 are fever , tiredness , and dry cough . Some patients may have aches and pains , nasal congestion , runny nose , sore throat or diarrhea . These symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually . 1/3 Some people become infected but do n't develop any symptoms and do n't feel unwell . Most people ( about 80 % ) recover from the disease without needing special treatment . Around 1 out of every 6 people who gets COVID - 19 becomes seriously ill and develops difficulty breathing . 2/3 Older people , and those with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure , heart problems or diabetes , are more likely to develop serious illness . People with fever , cough and difficulty breathing should seek medical attention . 3/3 How does COVID - 19 spread ? People can catch COVID - 19 from others who have the virus . The disease can spread from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth which are spread when a person with COVID - 19 coughs or exhales . 1/3 These droplets land on objects and surfaces around the person . Other people then catch COVID - 19 by touching these objects or surfaces , then touching their eyes , nose or mouth . 2/3 People can also catch COVID - 19 if they breathe in droplets from a person with COVID - 19 who coughs out or exhales droplets . This is why it is important to stay more than 1 meter ( 3 feet ) away from a person who is sick . 3/3 Can the virus that causes COVID - 19 be transmitted through the air ? Studies to date suggest that the virus that causes COVID - 19 is mainly transmitted through contact with respiratory droplets rather than through the air . Can CoVID - 19 be caught from a person who has no symptoms ? The main way the disease spreads is through respiratory droplets expelled by someone who is coughing . The risk of catching COVID - 19 from someone with no symptoms at all is very low . 1/2 However , many people with COVID - 19 experience only mild symptoms . This is particularly true at the early stages of the disease . It is therefore possible to catch COVID - 19 from someone who has , for example , just a mild cough and does not feel ill . 2/2	0

THREAD on #COVID19 spread & testing . How does COVID - 19 spread ? It spreads through respiratory droplets from coughs and sneezes .

Should I ask for testing ? Contact a healthcare provider if you or your child has symptoms such as cough , fever , or shortness of breath .

@USER In what way ? This one spreads far quicker , and it has already reached far more people than SARS did . Also , it takes 4 to 5 weeks to die , and so nobody knows the fatality death rate yet . @USER Right off , his data is wrong . It started early December - not the 29th December . Also the World Health Orgaization says it 's worse than SARS . @USER From WHO info page . Is COVID - 19 the same as SARS ? No . The virus that causes COVID - 19 and the one that causes Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome ( SARS ) are related to each other genetically , but they are different . SARS is more deadly but much less infectious than COVID - 19 . @USER Yes , I know that . But it takes approximately 5 weeks from the date of manifestation of the illness ( not the incubation period ) to die . Most people have not recovered yet . So the death rate might be a lot higher . The fact that SARS did n't spread easily means it was less dangerous . @USER If a disease only spreads to a thousand people , and it kills 10 % , that is only a 100 dead . If a disease spreads to 5 million people , and it kills 3 % ( current fatality rate ) , it kills 30,000 people . It is the ease of spreading that makes it more dangerous . @USER I would still put that on par with a bad flu bug , most people do n't die from it and that fatality percentage can change based on how it 's reacted to and where geographically you look . With proper prevention this wo n't result in a pandemic .	0

Can the virus that causes COVID - 19 be transmitted through the air ? Studies to date suggest that the virus that causes COVID - 19 is mainly transmitted through contact with respiratory droplets rather than through the air . How does COVID - 19 spread ? People can catch COVID - 19 from others who have the virus . The disease can spread from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth which are spread when a person with COVID - 19 coughs or exhales . These droplets land on objects and surfaces around the person . Other people then catch COVID - 19 by touching these objects or surfaces , then touching their eyes , nose or mouth . People can also catch COVID - 19 if they breathe in droplets from a person with COVID - 19 who coughs out or exhales droplets . This is why it is important to stay more than 1 meter ( 3 feet ) away from a person who is sick . World Health Organisation is assessing ongoing research on the ways COVID - 19 is spread and will continue to share updated findings . HTTPURL	0

"What is #herdimmunity threshold for #COVID19 ? A topic of much discussion due to large uncertainty & huge consequences for long term impact . New paper illustrates 1 key aspect that can reduce it substantially ( spoiler : we still do n't know value ) . Thread . HTTPURL Human populations are NOT WELL-MIXED & HOMOGENOUS , so calcs give likely upper bound . Q : So what is herd immunity threshold ( HIT ) for real pops ? A : * Usually * lower & it depends on variation among individuals in 3 things : 1 ) contact rates ; 2 ) susceptibility ; 3 ) infectiousness . Background : If we know reproductive number R0 for pathogen in population , herd immunity threshold ( HIT ) for WELL-MIXED HOMOGENOUS population is simply 1-1 / R0 . ( Note R0 varies w / behavior , host traits , environment so differs over time & space ) . In idealized population , early vaccination to HIT will prevent outbreak b / c Rt = R0 * S / N so Rt < 1 . However , an epidemic will overshoot HIT & infect larger fraction f of pop where f = 1 - exp ( - ( f * R0 ) ) . For R0 = 2.5 ( reasonable for COVID 19 in some pops ) , HIT = 0.6 , and f = 0.89 . These simple calculations & flu data are what led @USER to make early widely cited rough back of the envelope calculations that 40-70 % of pop would get infected without interventions . Most articles cited the 70 % * BUT * @USER knew that ... HTTPURL 1 ) If some individuals have few contacts then they are unlikely to be infected , lowering HIT . ( note : variation in contacts can lead to faster early spread ) . 2 ) If some are n't susceptible to infection that reduces HIT . 3 ) If some people do n't transmit that also reduces HIT . Positive correlations among these traits - if individuals w / more contacts are more susceptible and infectious - can make for very rapid changes in dynamics . Sadly not much empirical data on these correlations & limited data on predictors of variation on susc . & infect . However , see paper by @USER that is even better ( b / c more general , better data ) than Science paper cited above . Fig shows how variation susc , contacts affects HIT , f , for R0 = 3 ; so HIT = 0.66 , f = 0.94 . HTTPURL HTTPURL Science paper ( link above ) also shows how reasonable variation in contact rates among individuals reduces HIT . It considers differential mixing among age groups and hypothetical variation among individuals w / in each age group having more or fewer contacts . The strange part is that it 's not clear what source their age-mixing data comes from . The citation they give is NOT a published paper - it 's a link to a page w / Matlab files . It 's weird because there are several age-mixing datasets out there . @USER can probably provide best ones The take home of the science paper is that pops partially structured by age ( i . e . NOT well-mixed ) and w / arbitrary differential "" activity "" ( contact rates ) w / in ages can reduce HIT for R0 = 2.5 from 0.6 to 0.43 . HTTPURL The conclusion in the abstract is appropriately worded in making it clear that the paper is simply an illustration of a concept , not an actual estimate of the most likely value . HTTPURL What I find puzzling is that this paper is in Science . It 's a extremely simple modeling exercise , with arbitrarily chosen parameter values . It is n't as general as @USER paper cited above , and it 's not clear it has any new empirical data . Many older papers say same thing . @USER paper is much better in providing empirical estimates of heterogeneity & impacts on HIT , f based on data ( colored lines in figure ) . HTTPURL I 'd like to see uncertainty around those estimates of heterogeneity & some are very indirect estimates , but range of values is much better than arbitrarily chosen numbers and suggest heterogeneity is substantial . But ... Serological data from NYC suggest that either heterogeneity estimate is too large or R0 is much larger , or lockdown did nothing to stop outbreak as seroprevalence is already at overhsoot epidemic size f ( ~ 20 % - I added horiz dashed line ) . HTTPURL HTTPURL Together papers suggest herd immunity thresh is < 1-1 / R0 and epidemic overshoot < f = 1 - exp ( - ( f * R0 ) ) , but by how much is still unknown . Ugh . @USER smartly gave a wide range 40-70 % ( 20-60 % in later interviews ) for fraction infected f w / out interventions . HTTPURL Unfortunately , uncertainties in variation in contact rates and susceptibility / infectiousness will prevent us from ever having precise value for HIT for 1 pop & it will vary among populations ( as does R0 ) . The take home message is want to get to HIT by vaccination NOT infection . @USER @USER did some work on this in 2007 or so also when I recall correctly : “ "" A programme targeting just five per cent of the population could reduce the number of infected people to just one per cent of the scenario where no antiviral drugs were available . "" @USER @USER This is likely true for diseases with very strong heterogeneity ( i . e . a few important spreaders ; heterogeneity is thought to be less so for respiratory illnesses but still substantial ) . @USER Are you aware of any natural or experimental data showing significant divergence ( say > 10 % ) from the canonical immunity threshold ( aside from HIV or STIs with highly stratified risk groups ) ? #COVID19 @USER @USER without reading : the hu mangus differences in some people contracting and spreading . @USER @USER @USER unroll please @USER Salam , please find the unroll here : @USER : What is #herdimmunity threshold for #COVID19 ?

HTTPURL Talk to you soon . :robot_face: @USER @USER Do we know yet how much immunity someone who has recovered from the virus has , how long it lasts ? @USER @USER Not yet , sadly ! @USER Yes . See link at end to interview with @USER that mentions examples that indicate that heterogeneity can be substantial . @USER @USER "" What is this about nerd immunity ?

Q . Is it safe to receive a package from any area where COVID - 19 has been reported ? A . Yes .

The new coronavirus CANNOT be transmitted through mosquito bites . To date there has been no information nor evidence to suggest that the new coronavirus could be transmitted by mosquitoes . Are hand dryers effective in killing the new coronavirus ? No . Hand dryers are not effective in killing the 2019 - nCoV . To protect yourself against the new coronavirus , you should frequently clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water . Can an ultraviolet disinfection lamp kill the new coronavirus ? UV lamps should not be used to sterilize hands or other areas of skin as UV radiation can cause skin irritation . HTTPURL How effective are thermal scanners in detecting people infected with the new coronavirus ? Thermal scanners are effective in detecting people who have developed a fever ( i . e . have a higher than normal body temperature ) because of infection with the new coronavirus . However , they can not detect people who are infected but are not yet sick with fever . This is because it takes between 2 and 10 days before people who are infected become sick and develop a fever . HTTPURL Can spraying alcohol or chlorine all over your body kill the new coronavirus ? No . Spraying alcohol or chlorine all over your body will not kill viruses that have already entered your body . Spraying such substances can be harmful to clothes or mucous membranes ( i . e . eyes , mouth ) . Be aware that both alcohol and chlorine can be useful to disinfect surfaces , but they need to be used under appropriate recommendations . HTTPURL Do vaccines against pneumonia protect you against the new coronavirus ? No . Vaccines against pneumonia , such as pneumococcal vaccine and Haemophilus influenza type B ( Hib ) vaccine , do not provide protection against the new coronavirus . The virus is so new and different that it needs its own vaccine . Researchers are trying to develop a vaccine against 2019 - nCoV , and WHO is supporting their efforts . Although these vaccines are not effective against 2019 - nCoV , vaccination against respiratory illnesses is highly recommended to protect your health . HTTPURL Can regularly rinsing your nose with saline help prevent infection with the new coronavirus ? No . There is no evidence that regularly rinsing the nose with saline has protected people from infection with the new coronavirus . There is some limited evidence that regularly rinsing nose with saline can help people recover more quickly from the common cold . However , regularly rinsing the nose has not been shown to prevent respiratory infections . HTTPURL Can eating garlic help prevent infection with the new coronavirus ? Garlic is a healthy food that may have some antimicrobial properties . However , there is no evidence from the current outbreak that eating garlic has protected people from the new coronavirus . HTTPURL Does the new coronavirus affect older people , or are younger people also susceptible ? People of all ages can be infected by the new coronavirus ( 2019 - nCoV ) . Older people , and people with pre-existing medical conditions ( such as asthma , diabetes , heart disease ) appear to be more vulnerable to becoming severely ill with the virus . WHO advises people of all ages to take steps to protect themselves from the virus , for example by following good hand hygiene and good respiratory hygiene . HTTPURL Are antibiotics effective in preventing and treating the new coronavirus ? No , antibiotics do not work against viruses , only bacteria . The new coronavirus ( 2019 - nCoV ) is a virus and , therefore , antibiotics should not be used as a means of prevention or treatment . However , if you are hospitalized for the 2019 - nCoV , you may receive antibiotics because bacterial co-infection is possible . HTTPURL Are there any specific medicines to prevent or treat the new coronavirus ? To date , there is no specific medicine recommended to prevent or treat the new coronavirus ( 2019 - nCoV ) . However , those infected with the virus should receive appropriate care to relieve and treat symptoms , and those with severe illness should receive optimized supportive care . Some specific treatments are under investigation , and will be tested through clinical trials . WHO is helping to accelerate research and development efforts with a range or partners .

@USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER So IFS for NY State is around 0.8 % and for the older UK population should be around 0.9 % .

I have a theory ... @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER Correction , @USER does n't seem to attribute all excess deaths to covid 19 infections . A significant fraction may have resulted from indirect effects of the epidemic HTTPURL @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER Elsewhere , I have read that 40 % of UK deaths are in care homes . HTTPURL But 400K residents care homes is only 0.6 % of the UK population . What may be happening is care homes are a lot further along the road to herd immunity than the rest of us . @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER If in a years time 80 % of people in care and 80 % of the rest of us have been infected , it will all come out in the wash and the iFR will be ( probably ? ) 0.9- 1 % for the UK , but if right now we have - I dunno - 4 % in the community and 20 % in care it will artificially raise the IFR . @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER The acid test will be what happens to excess deaths after the wave passes . If it turns negative that will indicate some of the deaths were of people where their end was hastened by a few weeks . If it just returns to zero that will show that they were robbed of years .	0

"Panelists : Beaumont Public Health Director Sherry Ulmer Beaumont Emergency Management Coordinator Tim Ocnashek BISD Assistant Superintendent of Elementary Education Anita Frank From Beaumont Psychiatric Clinic , Jason Mensah First , what is a coronavirus ? Ulmer : This particular strain started in Wuhan Province . It traveled from animals to humans . She said people often are first tested for the flu and strep throat so those conditions can be ruled out first . Ulmer adds there have been no confirmed cases in Beaumont or Jefferson County . She said she does n't want to downplay the flu . With both viruses , the biggest concern is for older people and people whose immune systems are compromised . "" We 're fortunate we have a vaccine for the flu . "" "" If we 're familiar with it , it 's less scary to us . "" She notes because COVID - 19 is so new , there 's little knowledge about what it will do and at this time no vaccine . Ulmer says she does n't know how many cases are in Texas , but Mensah says there are 51 . Ulmer said she knows 80 percent of people who get coronavirus will just get ( essentially ) the common cold . I 'm trying to get more info on this stat she 's quoting . I know ( thanks to #TheDaily I think ) that the study that showed 80 percent of people get mild symptoms included pneumonia . So , mild is relative here . Ulmer said she 's hearing anywhere between one and two years for the timeline to develop a vaccine . She says that 's why it 's important to continue "" tried and true "" healthcare methods . Wash your hands , stay home when you 're sick . Clean services with antibacterial and antiviral sprays . Lysol , Clorox and 409 are CDC-approved to kill the virus . "" We understand that the virus can last on surfaces for up to three hours . "" Feldschau asks how coronavirus is spread . He gives some facts he 's heard and asks the panel to separate fact and fiction . He 's been told it spreads through coughing and sneezing , lives several hours airborne and three days on hard surfaces and a person is contagious for 37 days . Ulmer reiterates that the virus lasts for three hours on hard surfaces . The virus is transmitted person-to-person . She says that can include being in close quarters with someone , simply talking to them because you can breath in the droplets . That 's why six feet is the recommendation when doing social distancing . Ulmer said the health department is putting together "" soemthing "" so people know what the next step is if Jefferson County has a confirmed case . ( I 'm going to use Tim 's first name because his last name is hard to keep spelling . ) So ... Tim says the city wants to reduce the spread by taking preemptive measures . That includes limiting crowds , increasing the outreach and the encouragement of people to take precautionary 1/2 measures . I would like to add , as of Friday , the city had not cancelled any events that would limit crowds . The comment was at this time , danger is not high enough that that consideration needed to be taken . 2/2 Tim says "" we 're not trying to scare people . There 's a lot of bad information out there . "" He encourages people to get information only from reputable sources , instead of looking at things on Facebook or from friends and spreading it like it 's a fact . "" We would encourage people to be patient because it 's a fluid situation . "" - Feldshau He notes that people questioned having a live audience when the panel was announced earlier this week . However when advice was given to keep events small , the church went to live streaming . Ulmer says the city nine years ago developed a pandemic plan . And several times a year , the city gets together to talk about the plans and practice them . "" We are as prepared as we can be with the information we 're getting . Of course it 's fluid , but we 're accustomed to these types of situations . "" Reiterating a point made previous , people most at risk are those 65 and older and those with preexisting conditions . She said children diagnosed with coronavirus 19 years and under are "" doing very well . "" "" For our children it sounds like God has smiled on us . "" Now talking about "" flattening the curve . "" People are trying to take protective measures to flatten the peak of infections . "" This is not here today and gone tomorrow . "" - Feldschau Ulmer said allowing the infections to peak so high would "" tax our healthcare system . "" Should the city / county get there , it would have to look at "" alternative "" ways to treat people . She did n't expand on what those alternatives are . She said that 's one reason why people should call their doctor or emergency rooms before just showing up . "" I we know that you 're coming , the staff can be ready for you . They can meet you outside , they can give you a mask ... that 's one way now we 're trying to alleviate the workload on the healthcare system is to try to plan 1/2 as best we can that people are going to be expected to coming in with complaints of difficulty breathing and thoughts of coronavirus . "" 2/2 Feldshau says the state of emergency is not for where we are now , but as a precaution to avoid losing control in the future . "" If we ever lose control , we 're going to have a serious problem . "" From comment section on the video : "" If this virus is just like the flu & spreads like viruses do ( airborne ) I 'm not understanding the panic & closure of so many things ? What is it about this virus that we would want to close schools churches etc but we do n't do it for flu ? "" This seems to be one of the most liked and loved comments . Someone simply responded "" yassss "" and another said people do n't know what to do "" so they just shut everything down I guess . "" So even on a live stream intended to give people information and was very clear on why precautions are being taken ..."	0

# 6 : How does COVID - 19 spread ? A : We are learning more and more about how COVID - 19 spreads . Evidence originally was very strong that it was present in the droplets of people who were infected .

This is part of the reason it is very hard to contain and slow the spread of COVID - 19 without taking the current measures of social distancing . HTTPURL	0

ethanol , peracetic acid and chloroform . However , they have little or no impact on the virus if you put them on the skin or under your nose .

Private practice has been changing in recent years , so governance can be complicated – there are self-employed pathologists and privately employed scientists in private practice and NHS employed-pathologists and privately employed scientists in the public – private joint ventures . Regulation and accreditation in the NHS is broad and thorough . It is mirrored , though , across the private sector – CQC , GMC , HCPC , UKAS , NHSBT , SHOT and EQA . The regulatory burden is shared . Global shortages make procurement a dog-eat-dog world . Related pressures also meant that testing restrictions were in place . New programmes needed to be developed : lighthouse labs and the Francis Crick Institute are two great examples . QA layers for field labs : UK NEQAS , UKAS visits and visit check list : e . g . operational management , staffing , BCT , liability and indemnity , SOPs , trouble shooting , training , competencies , IQC , EQA , validation , transport , follow-up , sample and specimen reception , PPE and on and on Questions may arise around UKAS accreditation – do they meet ISO 15189 ? No , but highly unlikely to achieve in such a short space of time . Is there integrated IT ? In some cases . What is their role in serology ? To ponder for the future . Now running through community testing example of Brent and Harrow CCG . Service setup within a week of formal request and another CCG seeking the service . But , misunderstanding remains – ' Why can't it be like IKEA ? ' Understanding of labs and services needs to be more widespread .

"What is COVID 19 ? Coronaviruses are important human and animal pathogens . They have been known to cause a variety of disorders in humans , from the common cold to the more severe Middle East Respiratory Syndrome ( MERS-CoV ) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome ( SARS-CoV ) . In December 2019 , a novel coronavirus was identified in emerging clusters of pneumonia ( lung infection ) cases in Wuhan , China . The virus was previously termed “ nCoV - 2019 ” . At the beginning of 2020 , the virus was officially named SARS-CoV - 2 , due to its similarities to the previous How does COVID - 19 spread ? Initially , experts believe the virus started out in animals in Wuhan , China ; and was then transmitted to humans . The current version of the SARS-CoV - 2 spreads from person-to-person , similar to the flu . This usually happens when a sick person coughs or SARS-CoV . The disease , as a whole , was then officially termed by the WHO as Coronavirus Disease 2019 , or “ COVID - 19 ” . sneezes near other people , or when a person is in close contact with a sick person ( within about 6 feet or 2 meters ) . What are the symptoms of COVID - 19 ? Symptoms usually start a few days after a person is infected with the virus . But in some people , it can take even longer for symptoms to appear , thus the symptoms can appear anywhere between 2 to 14 days after exposure . Symptoms can include : • Fever • Cough • Trouble breathing • Feeling tired • Muscle aches Most people have mild symptoms . Some people have no symptoms at all . But in other people , COVID - 19 can lead to serious problems like pneumonia , not getting enough oxygen , or even death . This is more common in people who are older or have other health problems . When should I see a doctor ? If you have a fever , cough , or trouble breathing and might have been exposed to COVID - 19 , call 937 ( The Saudi MOH Service Center ) immediately . You might have been exposed if either of the following happened within the last 14 days : • You lived in , or traveled to , an area where lots of people have the virus – the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) has information about which areas are affected . This can be found on their website : HTTPURL ncov / travelers / index.html • You had close contact with a person who has the virus – This generally means being within about 6 feet of the person . If your symptoms are not severe , it is best to call your doctor , nurse , or clinic before you go in . They can tell you what to do and where to go . If you do need to go to the clinic or hospital , you will need to put on a face mask . The staff might also have you wait someplace away from other people . If you are severely ill and need to go to the clinic or hospital right away , you should still call ahead . This way the staff can care for you while taking steps to protect others . How is COVID - 19 treated ? Most people with COVID - 19 have only mild illness and can rest at home until they get better . If you have a more severe illness , you might need to stay in the hospital , possibly in the intensive care unit ( also called the "" ICU "" ) . There is no specific treatment for the infection , but the doctors and nurses in the hospital can monitor and support your breathing and other body functions ; and make you as comfortable as possible , this is done through multiple ways , including external oxygen ( e . g . oxygen mask ) , a ventilator ( a machine that helps you breathe ) , and / or medication . Can COVID - 19 be prevented ? There are things you can do to reduce your chances of getting COVID - 19 : • Wash your hands with soap and water often . Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds , especially after blowing your nose , coughing , or sneezing ; going to the bathroom ; and before eating or preparing food . o If soap and water are not readily available , use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60 % alcohol , covering all surfaces of your hands and rubbing them together until they feel dry . • Avoid touching your face ( including your eyes , mouth , and nose ) with your hands • Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue , then throw the tissue in the trash , and wash your hands immediately after ( as specified above ) . • Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces using a regular household cleaning spray or wipe . • CDC does not recommend that people who are well and healthy wear a facemask to protect themselves from respiratory diseases , including COVID - 19 . o Facemasks should be used by people who show symptoms of COVID - 19 to help prevent the spread of the disease to others . The use of facemasks is also crucial for health workers and people who are taking care of someone who has COVID - 19 . • Stay home when you are sick , and call your doctor if you think you have been exposed to COVID - 19 . • Try to stay away from people who have any symptoms of the infection . • Some experts recommend avoiding travel to certain countries where there are a lot of cases of COVID - 19 . If someone in your home has COVID - 19 , there are additional things you can do to protect yourself : • Keep the sick person away from others – The sick person should stay in a separate room and use a separate bathroom if possible . • Use face masks – The sick person should wear a face mask when they are in the same room as other people . If you are caring for the sick person , you can also protect yourself by wearing a face mask when you are in the room . This is especially important if the sick person can not wear a mask . • Be extra careful around body fluids – If you will be in contact with the sick person 's blood , mucus , or other body fluids , wear a disposable face mask , gown , and gloves . If any bodily fluids touch your skin , wash your hands with soap right away . • Clean often – It 's especially important to clean things that are touched a lot . This includes counters , bedside tables , doorknobs , computers , phones , tablets , and bathroom surfaces . Also , clean any surfaces that may have blood , stool , or body fluids on them . • Wash hands – Wash your hands with soap and water often ( as specified above ) • You should not share dishes , drinking glasses , cups , eating utensils , towels , or bedding with other people or pets in your home . There is not yet a vaccine to prevent COVID - 19 . How can I prepare for a possible outbreak ? It is hard to predict where future outbreaks might happen . The best thing you can do to stay healthy is to wash your hands regularly , avoid close contact with people who are sick , and stay home if you are sick . If there is an outbreak in your area , schools or businesses might close temporarily . If this happens , or if someone in your family gets sick with COVID - 19 , you might need to stay at home for a period of time . There are things you can do to prepare for this . For example , you might be able to ask your employer if you can work from home , or take time off , if it becomes necessary . You can also make sure you have a way to get in touch with relatives , neighbors , and others in your area . This way you will be able to receive and share information easily . If you or others in your family are anxious about COVID - 19 , keep in mind that most people do not get severely ill or die from it . While it helps to be prepared , and there are things you can do to lower your risk . Where can I learn more ? As we learn more about this virus , expert recommendations will continue to change . Check with your doctor or public health official to get the most updated information about how to protect yourself . You can also find more information about COVID - 19 at the following : • United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ): HTTPURL • World Health Organization ( WHO ): HTTPURL • The Saudi Ministry of Health ( MOH ): HTTPURL • Saudi MOH Coronavirus Service Center Number : 937 • Saudi National Ambulance Hotline : 997"	0

Only older adults and young people are at risk COVID - 19 , like other coronaviruses , can infect people of any age . However , older adults or individuals with preexisting health conditions , such as diabetes or asthma , are more likely to become severely ill . 3 .

covid - 19 myths vs truth HTTPURL Exposing yourself to the sun or to temperatures higher than 25C degrees DOES NOT prevent the coronavirus disease ( COVID - 19 ) You can catch COVID - 19 , no matter how sunny or hot the weather is . Countries with hot weather have reported cases of COVID - 19 . You can recover from the coronavirus disease ( COVID - 19 ) . Catching covid - 19 DOES NOT mean you will have it for life . Most of the people who catch COVID - 19 can recover and eliminate the virus from their bodies . If you catch the disease , make sure you treat your symptoms . Being able to hold your breath for 10 seconds or more without coughing or feeling discomfort DOES NOT mean you are free from the COVID - 19 or any other lung disease . The most common symptoms of COVID - 19 are dry cough , tiredness and fever . Take an official test to confirm . Drinking alcohol does not protect you against COVID - 19 and can be dangerous Frequent or excessive alcohol consumption can increase your risk of health problems and can in fact damage your immune system - which helps fight against the virus . COVID - 19 virus can be transmitted in areas with hot and humid climates From the evidence so far , the COVID - 19 virus can be transmitted in ALL AREAS , including areas with hot and humid weather . Regardless of climate , adopt protective measures when leaving the house for essentials Cold weather and snow CANNOT kill the new coronavirus . There is no reason to believe that cold weather can kill the new coronavirus or other diseases . The normal human body temperature remains around 36.5 ° C to 37 ° C , regardless of the external temperature or weather . Taking a hot bath does not prevent the virus Taking a hot bath will not prevent you from catching COVID - 19 . Your body temperature is 36.5 ° C to 37 ° C , regardless of the temperature of your bath or shower . Taking a hot bath with extremely hot water can be harmful , as it can burn you The new coronavirus CANNOT be transmitted through mosquito bites . To date there has been no information nor evidence to suggest that the new coronavirus could be transmitted by mosquitoes . The coronavirus is a respiratory virus which spreads primarily through droplets .	0

"Brain teaser : Assume that 5 % of the population has #COVID19 antibodies , and the serology test has a 95 % accuracy ( specificity = sensitivity = 0.95 ) . What is the probability p that I have antibodies if I test positive ? ( For bonus points explain your answer in comments ) @USER Hint : Thomas Bayes would be of great help @USER Strict inequalities . @USER Prior and likelihood neutralize each other exactly @USER Not needed to respond the teaser . @USER P ( covid = Y )= 0.05 P ( test = Y )= 0.095 P ( test = Y | covid = Y )= 0.95 @USER I 'm taking my chance and not reading the other replies beforehand . It 's 50/50 ! :face_screaming_in_fear: We have two random binary variables : TST ( good test ) and ATB ( antibodies present ) . Plus one observable : RES ( ult ) . Given same specificity and sensitivity , we can assume both vars are independent ( ? ) @USER Thus , among four possible combinations of TST x ATB , we have two that lead to RES =p ositive , i . e . , ( TST and ATB ) or ( not TST and not ATB ) . P ( TST , ATB )= P ( not TST , not ATB )= 0.0475 . So , 50/50 between these two possibilities . @USER 50 % HTTPURL @USER @USER hence the answer is the "" tricky "" d ) ( which I did not get , because I was n't watching for strict inequalities and thought I was picking "" greater than or equal to 50 but less than 95 "" ) @USER = 50 % . Could use Bayes , but ppl do n't understand that so do example : Suppose 10k ppl tested . at 5 % incidence 500 have antibodies , 9500 do n't . . 95 * 500 = 475 true positives . 0.05 * 9500 = 475 false negatives . FN = TP so you have no idea which of the two sets you are in so 0.5 @USER 400 person trial . 20 are positive . 380 negative . 361/380 of the negative test negative . 19/20 of the positive test positive . But 19/380 negative test positive . Any positive test is 50/50 a true positive or false negative . @USER 0.5 if you are a frequentist . If you are an hypochondriac Bayesian and you work in an hospital with COVID - 19 patients , i . e . , p ( antibodies ) > 0.05 , then the probability shifts towards 1 . @USER If you apply Bayes you get the same result . Of course , things change if you change the prior , but that is unrelated to frequentist vs . bayesian . @USER If I test positive I am either a FP or a TP . The number of FPs is the number of negatives ( 95 % of pop . ) x the chance of misclassifying them ( 5 % ) . The number of TPs is the number of positives ( 5 % of the pop . ) x the chance of correctly classifying them ( 95 % ) . Hence , p= 0.5 . @USER P ( Covid = Y | test = Y )= P ( test = Y | covid = Y ) P ( covid = Y ) / P ( test = Y ) ; 0.95 0.05 / 0.095 = 0.5 @USER Cheeky answer categories ! I 'm always entertained by how similar Bayes ' theorem and base rate neglect have similar names and are related to each other . @USER 50 % HTTPURL @USER One of my first go-to questions while interviewing data science candidates @USER True positives ( TP ): . 95 * 5 % False positives ( FP ): . 05 * 95 % = TP p = TP / ( TP + FP ) = 50 % @USER But , here is the issue . I can say I have a magical prediction power . Simply , I predict a negative result for everybody . And I win over the lab test ... but I have zero sensitivity ! @USER None of the above .

Example : "" When can we hug again ? "" . Answer : "" Hugging is good for you . "" If viewers want evasion , we get that with Trump 's press conferences . How about a good honest , "" I do n't know . "" ? Unless this was satire it was #wastedtime @USER @USER I miss the studio audience , too . Have you considered trying a Zoom virtual audience ? I could never see your show live , so I would love the opportunity to be a part of your Zoom audience ! @USER @USER Highlight of my week : I shave on Wednesdays .

Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses which may cause illness in animals or humans . In humans , several coronaviruses are known to cause respiratory infections ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome ( MERS ) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome ( SARS ) . The most recently discovered coronavirus causes coronavirus disease COVID - 19 . What is COVID - 19 is the infectious disease caused by the most recently discovered coronavirus . This new virus and disease were unknown before the outbreak began in Wuhan , China , in December 2019 . Symptoms The most common symptoms of COVID - 19 are fever , tiredness , and dry cough . Some patients may have aches and pains , nasal congestion , runny nose , sore throat or diarrhea . These symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually . Some people become infected but do n't develop any symptoms and do n't feel unwell.Most people ( about 80 % ) recover from the disease without needing special treatment . Around 1 out of every 6 people who gets COVID - 19 becomes seriously ill and develops difficulty breathing . Older people , and those with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure , heart problems or diabetes , are more likely to develop serious illness . People with fever , cough and difficulty breathing should seek medical attention . How does COVID - 19 spread ? People can catch COVID - 19 from others who have the virus . The disease can spread from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth which are spread when a person with COVID - 19 coughs or exhales . These droplets land on objects and surfaces around the person . Other people then catch COVID - 19 by touching these objects or surfaces , then touching their eyes , nose or mouth . People can also catch COVID - 19 if they eyes , nose or mouth . People can also catch COVID - 19 if they breathe in droplets from a person with COVID - 19 who coughs out or exhales droplets . This is why it is important to stay more than 1 meter ( 3 feet ) away from a person who is sick . Can the virus that causes COVID - 19 be transmitted through the air ? Studies to date suggest that the virus that causes COVID - 19 is mainly transmitted through contact with respiratory droplets rather than through the air . See previous answer on “ How does COVID - 19 spread ? ”	0

occupies several seats within this OMT . What is the scientific foundation of the OMT advice and what is the reason this ‘ herd immunity ' like strategy was adopted ? government deems the chosen strategy a success , or more specifically , that is the message the government tries to convey to the public . The government claims to have based their decision on sound scientific advice provided by the OMT . The Dutch centre for disease control ( RIVM ) .. Technical Briefing March 18th An important key in resolving these questions was provided in the parliamentary technical briefing of March 18th 2020 . In this briefing OMT chairman ... HTTPURL Jaap van Dissel presented the following ( figure 1 ) that outlined the strategic options that were considered by the OMT . Figure 1 , the 3 conceived COVID - 19 pandemic control strategies HTTPURL The three considered strategic options : 1 . No interventions , a worst-case scenario , where the virus is allowed to spread freely ( red ); 2 . Maximum control , a mitigation scenario , where social distancing decelerates the spread ( green ); 3 . Lock-down , a containment scenario , where .. mandatory isolation diminishes the spread ( blue ); had been evaluated using a model , for which to date no source code or parameters were made public . The lock-down scenario is kind of odd , it would have been expected that the post-maximum slope of this curve would be ... significantly steeper as compared to ‘ no interventions ' curve . Surprisingly , here the slope is even shallower than the ‘ maximum control ' slope . This suggests there is a feedback present , which decelerates the spread , in the model used to evaluate these strategic options . HTTPURL Simplified Epidemic Modelling Epidemic models can be conceptualised by a sequence of bins containing persons in different stages of a disease , a one-way transfer is considered , where persons transfer from one bin to the next . The rate at which persons transfer is described by ... a parameter . An example is the SEIR model this model considers four disease stages : 1 . Susceptible : persons that are susceptible to the pathogen , i . e . , not immune ; 2 . Exposed : persons that are exposed to the pathogen , but or not yet contagious ; 3 . Infected : persons that can spread the pathogen ; 4 . Recovered : persons that have recovered , i . e . , immune ; Figure 2 , SEIR model containing four disease stages . HTTPURL The transfer rates govern how long a person remains in a specific disease stage , e . g . , the duration of the infectious period is determined by parameters % delta and % gamma . Such a disease model does not directly consider adverse effects a disease may have , ... e . g . , disability to death . The previously noted feedback present in the model results presented at the technical briefing , suggests there is a parallel route ( figure 3 ) within the model used for ... Figure 3 , a parallel SEIR with a severe and asymptomatic route . HTTPURL scenario discrimination . Such a parallel route , if it runs via asymptomatic or paucisymptomatic persons , could provide for a path to recovered and therefore immune persons . The other route is comprised of symptomatic persons , which may require additional care . If the ... symptomatic persons are in their ‘ infectious bin ' for a longer duration , as compared to the asymptomatic or paucisymptomatic persons , this means that there will be a fast reservoir of immune persons quickly , i . e . , a huge dampening effect . As the pathway through ... asymptomatic or paucisymptomatic dominates over symptomatic persons . This parallel SEIR model , when applied to the COVID - 19 data available from Wuhan ( narrow spike ) , would yield the following conclusions about the virus : 1 . was highly infectious ( most infected people where not on the radar in Wuhan ); 2 . could not easily be contained . Figure 4 , Idealised SEIR-TTI model . HTTPURL Unfortunately , the parallel SEIR model is in a sense equivalent to a SEIR model that allows for track-trace-isolation ( TTI ) shown in figure 4 . Ironically , that is what the Chinese actually did , they aggressively tracked , traced , and isolated infected and suspected persons . ... This essentially halts transmission , the ‘ exposed bin ' is kept ( nearly ) empty . When the SEIR-TTI model is applied to the Wuhan data this would yield the following conclusions about the virus : 1 . was moderately infectious ; 2 . TTI was very effective . The suspected actual used model is more involved , as it is comprised of several age levels , e . g . , for each age cohort a more detailed SEIR-TTI equation is applied . When age separation is considered it may have appeared , based on Wuhan data that herd immunity could be build ... relatively cheaply and quickly by keeping younger people at work ( as the R0 would be hugely overestimated , while the severity of the disease was hugely underestimated ) , while vulnerable people kept home . A costly mistake as it has turned out . For more details and references see ( in Dutch ): HTTPURL	0

What is a coronavirus ? Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses which may cause illness in animals or humans . In humans , several coronaviruses are known to cause respiratory infections ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as MERS , SARS and now , COVID - 19 . What are the symptoms of COVID - 19 ? The most common symptoms of COVID - 19 are fever , tiredness , and dry cough . Some patients may have aches and pains , nasal congestion , runny nose , sore throat or diarrhea . These symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually . 1/3 Some people become infected but do n't develop any symptoms and do n't feel unwell . Most people ( about 80 % ) recover from the disease without needing special treatment . Around 1 out of every 6 people who gets COVID - 19 becomes seriously ill and develops difficulty breathing . 2/3 Older people , and those with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure , heart problems or diabetes , are more likely to develop serious illness . People with fever , cough and difficulty breathing should seek medical attention . 3/3 How does COVID - 19 spread ? People can catch COVID - 19 from others who have the virus . The disease can spread from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth which are spread when a person with COVID - 19 coughs or exhales . 1/3 These droplets land on objects and surfaces around the person . Other people then catch COVID - 19 by touching these objects or surfaces , then touching their eyes , nose or mouth . 2/3 People can also catch COVID - 19 if they breathe in droplets from a person with COVID - 19 who coughs out or exhales droplets . This is why it is important to stay more than 1 meter ( 3 feet ) away from a person who is sick . 3/3 Can the virus that causes COVID - 19 be transmitted through the air ? Studies to date suggest that the virus that causes COVID - 19 is mainly transmitted through contact with respiratory droplets rather than through the air . Can CoVID - 19 be caught from a person who has no symptoms ? The main way the disease spreads is through respiratory droplets expelled by someone who is coughing . The risk of catching COVID - 19 from someone with no symptoms at all is very low . 1/2 However , many people with COVID - 19 experience only mild symptoms . This is particularly true at the early stages of the disease . It is therefore possible to catch COVID - 19 from someone who has , for example , just a mild cough and does not feel ill . 2/2	0

It has been an honour working with Prof Bhaswati Patnaik ( Psy ) and Prof Navaneeta Rath ( Soc ) on this FAQ wrt Serological Antibody Test in @USER for #COVID19 @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER HTTPURL Q 's 1-17 Q1 : What is COVID - 19 ? A1 : It is the acronym for coronavirus disease 2019 caused by SARS-COV - 2 . Q2 : What is SARS-COV - 2 ? A2 : It is the acronym for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 , a virus . Q3 : What is serological antibody test in the context of COVID - 19 or SARS-COV - 2 ? A3 : Blood is taken from the veins and the serum / plasma put to a test to know whether the person has developed antibodies against the virus , SARS-COV - 2 , for the disease , COVID - 19 . Q4 : How long it takes to give the result of the serological antibody test ? A4 : It takes 15-30 minutes to get the result of the test . So , it is a rapid diagnostic test ( RDT ) . Q5 : Who would have developed antibodies against SARS-COV - 2 / COVID - 19 ? A5 : Only people who were infected by SARS-COV - 2 and had the disease COVID - 19 are likely to have developed antibodies against SARS-COV - 2 / COVID - 19 . Q6 : Why is the test conducted on population who are not known to have COVID - 19 ? A6 : Some people might have been infected but were either asymptomatic or were with symptoms but have not been tested . Hence , the test is conducted on population who are not known to have it . Q7 : Why the test has been initiated in Bhubaneswar , not in other cities of Odisha ? A7 : As Bhubaneswar has been declared as a hotspot and there is likelihood for the rapid spread in the city and from the city to other cities , the test has been initiated in Bhubaneswar . Q8 : What is the purpose of the test ? A8 : The purpose of the test is to help in disease surveillance . It will help us arrive at an estimate of how many people from different categories of population in Bhubaneswar that might have been affected . Q9 : Apart from random sampling for testing the population , who else can go for the antibody test ? A9 : Samples of people with Severe Acute Respiratory Infections ( SARI ) and Influenza like Illness ( ILI ) are also being collected apart from random sampling of asymptomatic people . Q10 : Who will identify the population and design the sample to be tested ? A10 : The Bhubaneswar Municipal Corporation ( BMC ) through experts from the health department have developed protocols for identifying population from among whom the sample is to be drawn for testing . Q11 : What will happen if the antibody test comes positive ? A11 : If the antibody test comes positive , the person 's swab samples may be sent for RT-PCR test . This is another confirmatory test to know whether the person is currently suffering from COVID - 19 . Q . 12 : Will serological antibody test help identify a person suffering from COVID - 19 ? A12 : No , as per current practise and guidelines from @USER & @USER , COVID - 19 + ve cases are to be identified through RT-PCR in designated laboratories / testing centres . Q13 : Will identifying people who have developed antibodies be helpful in treatment for those who are suffering from COVID - 19 ? A13 : An independent research protocol has to be developed where plasma from those who developed antibodies can be used to treat patients . Q14 : Will those identified with antibodies for COVID - 19 be immune from the disease ? A14 : Further research with people who have already developed antibodies will be required . Q . 15 : Whom should the residents of the city contact for the test ? A15 : The residents of the city may contact their respective RWA ( Resident Welfare Association ) , Auxiliary Nurse Midwives ( ANMs ) , Accredited Social Health Activist ( ASHA ) or ward officer for the test . Q16 : Where from these rapid kits have come to the state ? A16 : These rapid kits have been procured by @USER and have been supplied to Odisha . Q17 : How many rapid kits have been provided to Government of Odisha in the first phase ? A17 : @USER has provided 6000 rapid kits for the test to Odisha in the first phase . @USER @USER @USER The Odia version of the policy brief FAQs on rapid antibody test for SARS-CoV - 2 is now put up by @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER HTTPURL I am happy to share that @USER policy brief 17a ( ୧୭କ ) has been put up online by @USER HTTPURL @USER @USER @USER Have there been any studies on efficacy of treatment thtough plasma of recovered patients . @USER @USER @USER HTTPURL In statistical terms , the spike in new cases for 18th April should be considered as noise or outlier .

So another important data point to review each day is the percent positive of all patients tested , by PCR and Serology test types . What is “ percent positive ” ? Out of the total number of Missourians tested , it is the percentage that have had a positive test result . For June 1 , that percentage was 6.5 % for PCR tests and 4 % for Serology tests . HTTPURL You can also find a table showing how many tests were done each day in Missouri , and how many of those were positive . If you view that table , you will note that the number of positive tests daily has remained relatively stable , while the total number of tests daily has increased . That means the percentage of Missourians being diagnosed with COVID - 19 is lowering . To view this information to help understand the full picture , visit HTTPURL and select COVD - 19 Dashboard .

1 . Is it safe to receive a letter or a package from China ? Yes , it is safe . People receiving packages from China are not at risk of contracting the new coronavirus . From previous analysis , we know coronaviruses do not survive long on objects , such as letters or packages . The #coronavirus threat is still out there and with it comes the possibility of some misconceptions , especially those fake WhatsApp broadcasts . Here are some myths that have cropped up so far and facts by the @USER to debunk them . HTTPURL 2 . Can spraying alcohol or chlorine all over your body kill the new coronavirus ? No . Spraying alcohol or chlorine on your body will not kill viruses that have already entered your body . Rather , spraying such substances can be harmful to clothes or mucous membranes ( eyes , mouth ) . 3 . How effective are thermal scanners in detecting people infected with the new coronavirus ? Thermal scanners are effective in detecting people who have developed a fever because of infection . However , they can not detect people who are infected but are not yet sick with fever . 4 . Can an ultraviolet disinfection lamp kill the new coronavirus ? UV lamps should not be used to sterilize hands or other areas of skin as UV radiation can cause skin irritation . 5 . Are hand dryers effective in killing the new coronavirus ? No . Hand dryers are not effective in killing the new coronavirus . To protect yourself against the new coronavirus , you should frequently clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap & water . 6 . Can pets at home spread the new coronavirus ( 2019 - nCoV ) ? At present , there is no evidence that companion animals / pets such as dogs or cats can be infected with the new coronavirus . However , it is always a good idea to wash your hands with soap & water after contact with pets . 7 . Do vaccines against pneumonia protect you against the new coronavirus ? No . Vaccines against pneumonia offer no protection against the new coronavirus . The virus is so new and different that it needs its own vaccine . Researchers are trying to develop one & WHO is in support . 8 . Does the new coronavirus affect older people , or are younger people also susceptible ? People of all ages can be infected by the new coronavirus but older people & those with pre-existing medical conditions ( such as asthma , diabetes , etc . ) appear to be more vulnerable . WHO advises people of all ages to take steps to protect themselves from the virus , for example by following good hand hygiene and good respiratory hygiene . 9 . Are antibiotics effective in preventing and treating the new coronavirus ? No , antibiotics do not work against viruses , only bacteria . The new coronavirus ( 2019 - nCoV ) is a virus and , therefore , antibiotics should not be used as a means of prevention or treatment . 10 . Are there any specific medicines to prevent or treat the new coronavirus ? To date , there is no specific medicine recommended to prevent or treat the new coronavirus . However , those infected with the virus are receiving appropriate care to relieve and treat symptoms .	0

It seems much easier to do that than close everything for everyone @USER It is being blown out of proportion .

If NYC is saying 25 % of people have had it ( or whatever ) , what is stopping the other 75 % getting it ( or at least 35 % before you get herd immunity ) & dying at a rate of c0 . 7 % ? There is zero logic to it , unless you believe the serology number is wrong @USER Nothing . Did you listen to the whole interview ?

"@USER @USER @USER Unless it 's a majority , they can keep talking . Put it to a referendum . If the voters of a particular area want it taken down , they can say so . Otherwise , it should stay .

As a Hub , with the healthy state of people at heart @USER , we are also a bit curious about how best can one protect him or herself with the recent outbreak . Is there any known treatment for COVID 19 ? @USER @USER @USER It is called a pandemic because this previously unknown disease has spread from a particular locality to all over the world ... A pandemic is a disease outbreak that has spread over several countries or continents ... Another popular disease that is a pandemic is HIV / AIDS .

In your own understanding as a Heathcare Professional , Dr @USER , what supplies are most important to be gotten and kept during this pandemic period ? If someone absolutely has to go out , what should he / she do ? What should one do if they experience symptoms and can't get help through Govt Hospitals / no isolation centres in their state @USER ? What practical steps can be taken to protect the vulnerable groups like people with underlying medical issues / immune compromised individuals ? In rounding up Dr @USER , what is the protocol if i suspect i have COVID 19 in Rivers state ? What is the National and Rivers State COVID 19 emergency help lines ?

but I will live on ... where will you spend your eternity existing , in a free and wonderful place ... or in hell by believing the lies that its really the best place . hell is contrary to heaven . if hell is fire and brimstone , weeping , wailing , gnarling and gnashing of teeth and a worm that eats you but never dies ... like the maggots that feed off of rotting flesh ... I wont be afraid of no covid - 19 , nor a heart attack , nor suffering , nor death as tho its a suffering . I wont even fear my anxiety from my own brain disorder . the only one I revear that I fear in reverence is the LORD our GOD . because even the devil cant destroy a soul and body ... but only a body ... whats a body .. this spirit is willing , and God willing so is the flesh . because fear is a prison . keeping us locked up , broke , an suffering cabin fever .. fear harms the soul by keeping you busy from GOD to be greatful , and worship HIM rain or sunshine ... worship HIM the creator of your spirit , which is your existance . without Him your soul will suffer . or in otherwords covid - 19 fear without realizing that there are more survivors than there are deaths . look at all of you that are panicing and are puppets to the fear . the fear cant hurt you , not even when you are sick with covid - 19 ... so what is covid - 19 gonna do ? make me scared of dying and turning to my last resort which is GOD anyway . cmon why wait til the last minute and destroy the weapon of the devil which is fear . and have a relationship with God . 4 fear of the unknown breeds hatred and kills or causes sin basically because you turn from GOD who is love , and has plans for every christian , not to harm you , but prosper you , to give you a hope and a future .

@USER @USER western people are somewhat confined to thinking about individuals instead of the systems that they are a part of , create , and sustain . sorry to be an ass about it , but if you do n't understand this , you wo n't understand anything i say HTTPURL @USER @USER I actually just watched that video fairly recently , at @USER request . :purple_heart: To solve these sorts of problems , we definitely need systems thinking . I 'm reasonably educated in this area . Also spent many years working in semiconductor , on SPC & supply chain infrastructure . @USER @USER @USER I can see what you 're saying . Thank you . I think part of the issue is that I do n't think in hierarchies or boundaries . Why does “ systems thinking ” tend to go bigger instead of smaller ? Person = rose ( for now ) Pedals = mind Stem = body To be continued . :) @USER @USER @USER What about : Washington state = rose Pedals = citizen ( person ) Stem = government ( people ) United States = rose ... North America = rose ... World = rose Each pedal has its own needs ( notice they do n't all fall at once ) . To your point , there is a supply chain ... at every scale . @USER @USER @USER The original principle still applies . Some of the roses ( for you ) or pedals , or cells will be able to adapt - others wo n't - trying to make reactions go faster though , tends to result in a smaller yield , I think . @USER @USER @USER almost all rose bushes can recover from mites , mold , and other vermin if they are properly fed and watered . their survivability is not an innate trait but an effect of the relationship with their environment / context . @USER @USER @USER what 's failing is the system that arranged these 350 million this way ( see : DJIA collapse , international travel rates and lockdowns , etc ) . if we implement UBI so the 350m can buy their food reliably for 12 months , life will be peachy , but the oligarchy and corporatocracy wo n't @USER @USER @USER Do you think the 350M are ready to accept a UBI ? If the UBI is able to purchase basic food and housing , why do we need it ? Why not remove money entirely ? At what level of the collectives should a UBI be established ? ( Note : I have not said whether I am for or against a UBI . ) @USER @USER @USER accept is a mental state we need it because the current system of distribution ( Fed loans to commercial loans to payrolls ) is pretty much at a standstill and restarting will take a decade . each heartbeat gets a UBI @USER @USER @USER Reminds me of the Fiona Apple line : He said , “ It 's all in your head . ” I said , “ So 's everything but he did n't get it . ” ( State change = adaptation . ) Okay .

2 . What are the symptoms of COVID - 19 ? Symptoms can include fever , cough and shortness of breath . In more severe cases , infection can cause pneumonia or breathing difficulties . More rarely , the disease can be fatal . These symptoms are similar to the flu ( influenza ) or the common cold , which are a lot more common than COVID - 19 . This is why testing is required to confirm if someone has COVID - 19 . @USER Thanks for the highlight may Allah see us through	0

This article intrigued me . HTTPURL So , unless I have missed reading something important , the early release of lockdown is precisely what is going to put us into the worst of both worlds . On the assumption that regulated social distancing has added to the economic cost paid up front , in that what we saw would not have happened with purely private social distancing ... if we release now without enough test trace isolate [ sorry , very boring to continue to repeat ] ... ... then we 'll have created a > recession than needed for little gain , as we go back to a let the virus rip strategy . What gain there will have been will have been purely about trimming the top off the ' curve ' [ ie reducing peak case load ] and reducing mortality from lack of care . @USER Seems like a second wave is modestly unlikely ... Europe has returned without it Some US states have seen ' second wave ' but really this is just first wave not properly reduced @USER Possibly ; but one has to ask oneself what is different now from before . The virus is no different . Large scale surveys tell us that not all that many in eg Spain have had it [ 7 % ? ] so herd immunity very unlikely . Maybe private social distancing is enough . Climate ? Unlikely . @USER Major unknown factor for me in this is prior immunity from previous coronavirus exposure I can't make the evidence and theory fit otherwise , and proper epidemiologists like @USER do n't rule this out @USER @USER What have you read on that last point ?	0

Thread about some popular myths on corona virus 1 . Spraying chlorine or alcohol on skin kills viruses in the body Applying alcohol or chlorine to the body can cause more harm . Disinfect surfaces not skin These can not kill viruses within the body ! ! 2 . Older people ( > 60 ) and young ( < 14 ) are at risk SARS-CoV - 2 , like other coronaviruses , can infect people of any age . However , ANYONE with preexisting health conditions , like cancer , diabetes , lung infections , immunodeficiency is likely to get affected . 9 . SARS-CoV - 2 is just a mutated form of the common cold All Coronaviruses belong to family of coronoviridae and have surface spike proteins that help them invade host , which can be humans / animals . Covid 19 is thought to be passed from animals / poultry to humans . 6 . Cats and dogs spread coronavirus Currently , very little evidence . However , in Hong Kong , a Pomeranian whose owner had COVID - 19 became infected . The dog did not display any symptoms and this leads to an imp ques to differentiate infection from virus HTTPURL 7 . Face masks protect against coronavirus Disposable face masks may not provide protection . Yes it is better than nothing but most masks dont fit properly , droplets can still enter the mouth and nose . Thus viral particles can also enter . HTTPURL 8 . Hand dryers kill coronavirus Hand dryers DONT KILL . Only soap and water is the best way followed by alcohol based sanitizers to protect oneself 9-2 . Thus some infect humans and many infect animals too . The best way to avoid such infections is stop eating meat and follow a more satvik diet . This suggestion may draw flak from others but thats the truth . SARS and MERS were also passed 4m animals to humans . 10 . Antibiotics kill coronavirus Antibiotics only kill bacteria AND NOT viruses . 14 . Thermal scanners can diagnose coronavirus Thermal scanners can detect only fever that can be caused by many reasons COVID - 19 symptoms only 2 – 10 days after infection , and an infection person maybe completely normal to begin with . 15 . Flu and pneumonia vaccines protect against COVID - 19 As SARS-CoV - 2 is different than other viruses , no existing vaccines protect against infection . So please dont panic , follow the Govt rules of curfew / isolation & eat healthy . Finally dont forget to pray .

"@USER @USER sì ho risposto in modo analogo anche io e concordo , ed è proprio posta male la domanda . Cmq è ulteriormente complesso perchè nn è banale nemmeno dire che il consensus sia "" la vera scienza "" . @USER @USER La domanda secondo me è assolutamente legittima . Non è che è posta male , ma indica davvero il dubbio che attanaglia molti . "" A chi devo fare riferimento ? "" , "" di chi mi devo fidare "" , sono domande che si vedono molto spesso . @USER @USER La comunità scientifica racchiude le conoscenze che abbiamo verificato e nella maggioranza dei casi è ciò che va ' preso per riferimento , non bisogna riporre troppa fiducia nelle varie personalità . A prescindere dalla loro autorevolezza . @USER @USER ma nn sono quelli i temi su cui si chiede fiducia . Burioni nn fa un claim scientifico da 2 mesi . "" state a casa "" nn è un claim scientifico . E ' una opzione di policy con dei pro e dei contro che tra le tante cose ha un effetto sui tassi di contagio se eseguita . Non è scienza / @USER @USER scienza è dire "" se state a casa probabilmente il tasso di contagio si riduce "" . Il "" quindi state a casa a qualunque costo "" non è scienza . @USER @USER No . L'OMS ha detto che stare a casa è il miglior modo per ridurre i contagi . Non probabilmente . Lo hanno affermato con certezza . Ed è confermato dai numeri . Non lo dice Burioni , né nessun altro . Lo dice l'organizzazione mondiale della sanità . @USER @USER cmq no , è scientificamente provabile che il modo per garantire azzeramento dei contagi + che in ogni alternativa è uccidere tutti gli esseri umani . Se li uccidi tutti non hai + contagi tra umani . Partendo da lì , possiamo capire come il dire cosa "" minimizza "" nn serve mai a nulla . @USER @USER Quindi secondo te l'OMS dovrebbe consigliare di fare una strage ? A che pro , se il virus gira da settembre nel mondo e chissà quanta gente è contagiata ? @USER @USER Se vai sul loro sito sta scritto chiaramente che il modo migliore per prevenire il contagio è l'isolamento sociale , se tu poi ritieni che sia un altro il modo migliore stai dando la tua opinione . @USER @USER definisci "" migliore "" . Nn trovo su loro sito lista di tutte le possibili misure di contenimento con la stima della riduzione di r0 per ciascuna , e invece quello dovrebbero fare . Poi politica sceglie con loro ZITTI MENTRE SI SCEGLIE . @USER @USER Guarda la sezione "" What can I do to protect myself and prevent the spread of disease ? "" nelle FAQ per il pubblico e vedi tutti i suggerimenti che danno alle persone per ridurre al minimo il contagio @USER @USER La politica anche è responsabile della "" intromissione "" degli scienziati , eh . Se tu prendi una decisione e scarichi la colpa sul parere del tecnico , te ne stai lavando le mani . @USER @USER ancora , nn cogli cosa intendo . Loro devono dire "" chiusura fabbrica impatta X su tassi di contagio "" . Poi paese fa i suoi conti e decide se preferisce tenerle aperte o no , dato che ogni chiusura ha dei costi , economici e sociali , dall'analisi dei quali i medici devono stare fuori ."	0

There are lots of other reasons for good hygiene around pets , though . Some common bacteria can pass between animals and people , such as E.coli and Salmonella . Washing your hands with soap and water can guard against them . Who is most at risk ? In the 2002-2003 SARS outbreak , 8,422 people were infected and there were 916 deaths worldwide . The overall death rate for infected people was 11 % . But for infected people 24 and younger , the death rate was just 1 % , while for those aged 65 + it was 55 % . In short , anyone can catch a virus . But the effect it will have on you , and how seriously ill you might become , can be dependent on several other factors . Older people and anyone with pre-existing medical conditions , like asthma , diabetes or heart disease , appear to be more vulnerable to becoming severely ill with the new coronavirus , according to the WHO . Can regularly rinsing your nose with saline help prevent infection with the new coronavirus ? No . There is no evidence that regularly rinsing the nose with saline has protected people from infection with the new coronavirus . There is some limited evidence that regularly rinsing nose with saline can help people recover more quickly from the common cold . However , regularly rinsing the nose has not been shown to prevent respiratory infections . Can gargling mouthwash protect you from infection with the new coronavirus ? No . There is no evidence that using mouthwash will protect you from infection with the new coronavirus . Some brands or mouthwash can eliminate certain microbes for a few minutes in the saliva in your mouth . However , this does not mean they protect you from 2019 - nCoV infection . The World Health Organization recommends taking the following precautions : 1 . Frequently clean hands by using alcohol-based hand rub or soap and water 2 . When coughing and sneezing cover mouth and nose with flexed elbow or tissue – throw tissue away immediately and wash hands 3 . Avoid close contact with anyone who has fever and cough 4 . If you have fever , cough and difficulty breathing seek medical care early and share previous travel history with your healthcare provider 5 . When visiting live markets in areas currently experiencing cases of novel coronavirus , avoid direct unprotected contact with live animals and surfaces in contact with animals 6 . The consumption of raw or undercooked animal products should be avoided . Raw meat , milk or animal organs should be handled with care , to avoid cross-contamination with uncooked foods , as per good food safety practices .	0

Part 6 How does COVID - 19 spread ? People can catch COVID - 19 from others who have the virus . The disease can spread from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth which are spread when a person with COVID - 19 coughs or exhales . #FREDIBOAT Part 10 Can CoVID - 19 be caught from a person who has no symptoms ? The main way the disease spreads is through respiratory droplets expelled by someone who is coughing . The risk of catching COVID - 19 from someone with no symptoms at all is very low . However , #FREDIBOAT Part 11 many people with COVID - 19 experience only mild symptoms . This is particularly true at the early stages of the disease . It is therefore possible to catch COVID - 19 from someone who has , for example , just a mild cough and does not feel ill . #FREDIBOAT Part 12 WHO is assessing ongoing research on the period of transmission of COVID - 19 and will continue to share updated findings . #FREDIBOAT Part 13 Can I catch COVID - 19 from the feces of someone with the disease ? The risk of catching COVID - 19 from the feces of an infected person appears to be low . While initial investigations suggest the virus may be present in feces in some cases , spread through this #FREDIBOAT Part 14 route is not a main feature of the outbreak . WHO is assessing ongoing research on the ways COVID - 19 is spread and will continue to share new findings . #FREDIBOAT Part 15 Because this is a risk , however , it is another reason to clean hands regularly , after using the bathroom and before eating #FREDIBOAT Part 16 What can I do to protect myself and prevent the spread of disease ? Protection measures for everyone Stay aware of the latest information on the COVID - 19 outbreak , available on the WHO website and through your national and local public health authority . #FREDIBOAT Part 17 Many countries around the world have seen cases of COVID - 19 and several have seen outbreaks . Authorities in China and some other countries have succeeded in slowing or stopping their outbreaks . However , the situation is unpredictable so check regularly #FREDIBOAT for the latest news . Part 18 You can reduce your chances of being infected or spreading COVID - 19 by taking some simple precautions : Regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water . Why ? Washing your hands with #FREDIBOAT Part 20 surfaces and can pick up viruses . Once contaminated , hands can transfer the virus to your eyes , nose or mouth . From there , the virus can enter your body and can make you sick . Make sure you , and the people around you , follow good respiratory hygiene . #FREDIBOAT Part 21 This means covering your mouth and nose with your bent elbow or tissue when you cough or sneeze . Then dispose of the used tissue immediately . Why ? Droplets spread virus . By following good respiratory hygiene you protect the people around you from viruses such as Part 22 cold , flu and COVID - 19 . Stay home if you feel unwell . If you have a fever , cough and difficulty breathing , seek medical attention and call in advance . Follow the directions of your local health authority . Why ? National and local authorities will #FREDIBOAT Part 23 have the most up to date information on the situation in your area . Calling in advance will allow your health care provider to quickly direct you to the right health facility . This will also protect you and help prevent spread of viruses and other infections . #FREDIBOAT Part 24 Keep up to date on the latest COVID - 19 hotspots ( cities or local areas where COVID - 19 is spreading widely ) . If possible , avoid traveling to places – especially if you are an older person or have diabetes , heart or lung disease . Why ? #FREDIBOAT Part 25 You have a higher chance of catching COVID - 19 in one of these areas . * * * Protection measures for persons who are in or have recently visited ( past 14 days ) areas where COVID - 19 is spreading Follow the guidance outlined above ( Protection measures for #FREDIBOAT Part 26 everyone ) Self-isolate by staying at home if you begin to feel unwell , even with mild symptoms such as headache , low grade fever ( 37.3 C or above ) and slight runny nose , until you recover . If it is essential for you to have someone bring you supplies or #FREDIBOAT Part 27 to go out , e . g . to buy food , then wear a mask to avoid infecting other people . Why ? Avoiding contact with others and visits to medical facilities will allow these facilities to operate more effectively and help protect you and others from possible COVID - 19 #FREDIBOAT Part 28 Why ? Calling in advance will allow your health care provider to quickly direct you to the right health facility . This will also help to prevent possible spread of COVID - 19 and other viruses . #FREDIBOAT Part 29 How likely am I to catch COVID - 19 ? The risk depends on where you are - and more specifically , whether there is a COVID - 19 outbreak unfolding there . For most people in most locations the risk of catching COVID - 19 is still low . However , there are now places around Part 30 the world ( cities or areas ) where the disease is spreading . For people living in , or visiting , these areas the risk of catching COVID - 19 is higher . Governments and health authorities are taking vigorous action every time a new case of COVID - 19 is identified . Be sure to Part 31 comply with any local restrictions on travel , movement or large gatherings . Cooperating with disease control efforts will reduce your risk of catching or spreading COVID - 19 . COVID - 19 outbreaks can be contained and transmission stopped , as has been shown in #FREDIBOAT Part 32 China and some other countries . Unfortunately , new outbreaks can emerge rapidly . It 's important to be aware of the situation where you are or intend to go . WHO publishes daily updates on the COVID - 19 situation worldwide . You can see these at HTTPURL	0

Q . What is a CoronaVirus ? A : Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses which may cause illness in animals or humans . In humans , several coronaviruses are known to cause respiratory infections ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases . #coronavirus #coronavirusindia Q . What is COVID - 19 ? A . COVID - 19 is the infectious disease caused by the most recently discovered coronavirus . This new virus and disease were unknown before the outbreak began in Wuhan , China , in December 2019 . Q . What are the symptoms of COVID - 19 ? A . The most common symptoms of COVID - 19 are fever , tiredness , and dry cough . Some patients may have aches and pains , nasal congestion , runny nose , sore throat or diarrhea . These symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually . #coronavirus Q . How fatal is COVID - 19 ? A . [ 1/3 ] Most people ( about 80 % ) recover from the disease without needing special treatment . Around 1 out of every 6 people who gets COVID - 19 becomes seriously ill and develops difficulty breathing . [ 2/3 ] Older people , and those with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure , heart problems or diabetes , are more likely to develop serious illness . About 2 % of people with the disease have died . #CoronavirusOutbreak #coronavirusindia Q . How does COVID - 19 spreads ? A . [ 1/3 ] People can catch COVID - 19 from others who have the virus . The disease can spread from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth which are spread when a person with COVID - 19 coughs or exhales . #CoronaVirusUpdates [ 2/3 ] These droplets land on objects and surfaces around the person . Other people then catch COVID - 19 by touching these objects or surfaces , then touching their eyes , nose or mouth . #CoronaAlert #coronavirus [ 3/3 ] People can also catch COVID - 19 if they breathe in droplets from a person with COVID - 19 who coughs out or exhales droplets . This is why it is important to stay more than 1 meter ( 3 feet ) away from a person who is sick . #coronavirusindia Q . Can the virus that causes COVID - 19 be transmitted through the air ? A . Studies to date suggest that the virus that causes COVID - 19 is mainly transmitted through contact with respiratory droplets rather than through the air . #coronavirus #coronovirusindia Q . Can CoVID - 19 be caught from a person who has no symptoms ? A . [ 1/2 ] The risk of catching COVID - 19 from someone with no symptoms at all is very low . But many people with COVID - 19 experience only mild symptoms in the early stages . [ 2/2 ] It is therefore possible to catch COVID - 19 from someone who might be infected but has , for example , just a mild cough and does not feel ill . #Corona #coronavirusindia	0

Just as fast as the virus has spread so has the misinformation surrounding COVID - 19 which can be equally as harmful . In this thread you 'll find many of the popular theories debunked as outlined by the @USER . 5G mobile networks DO NOT spread COVID - 19 Viruses can not travel on radio waves / mobile networks . COVID - 19 is spreading in many countries that do not have 5G mobile networks . COVID - 19 is spread through respiratoatry droplets when an infected person coughs , sneezes or speaks . Exposing yourself to the sun or to temperatures higher than 25C degrees DOES NOT prevent the coronavirus disease ( COVID - 19 ) Evidenced by the surge here at home you can catch COVID - 19 , no matter how sunny or hot the weather is . Countries with hot weather have had numerous cases . The new coronavirus CANNOT be transmitted through mosquito bites . To date there has been no information nor evidence to suggest that the new coronavirus could be transmitted by mosquitoes . Black People Can Get Corona . Data on race and the virus is too limited to draw sweeping conclusions , but disparate rates of sickness and death have emerged in some places . COVID - 19 is infecting and killing black people in the US at disproportionately high rates . @USER @USER @USER People actually think it goes through mobile networks ? ? ? #NoHope	0

"I moved to another city and drowned myself in Bishop David Oyedepo 's book - UNDERSTANDING DIVINE DIRECTION . I tried applying for jobs during this period and never did I get one . See , I have a very great CV , good schools , excellent grades and awesome work experience . As at that time , I had worked for an Impact Accelerator and Consulting firm in Nairobi , did a three year stint in two large commercial banks with several volunteering experiences . The first test invite I got , I passed and was asked to stay back for an interview same day . I was equally successful and was called to see the CEO which was the last stage of the recruitment process . Maybe my price scared them , I was not called back as promised . The second one I ever got much later , I argued with my interviewer who felt he knew everything . LOL . I did n't get both jobs . Thank God . I am sure God was looking at me and shaking his head like "" see this boy I gave a master-plan trying to run the race of someone else "" . What am I trying to say ? Everybody has their lane . That a particular trade is booming for someone you know does not mean it will boom for you . You do not know what they know . Forget the glamorous results you see , people 's secret efforts settles most of these things outwardly . Discover your own lane and that is where you will shine effortlessly . This does not in anyway downplay the part of hard work . You will work extra hard and even harder as you go up . Succeeding is easy . Staying successful is not . Many times you see many people post their achievements and accolades on social media and you say to yourself ' why not me ? ' When will it be my own turn ? Do they have two heads ? etc . No ! Nothing is wrong with you . Just discover your own lane and press forward . YOU ARE YOU ! ! ! Most people will not even write about their failures . I AM SUPER PROUD OF MY FAILURES . I failed forward . My failures gave me more lessons and earned me the right and boldness to teach other people about business . Your failures are a plus . You learn never to do things that same way . Reason I embraced the lean approach . I learnt how to start a business with a very little cost , validate and then grow it . HTTPURL ( @USER ) is a clear example . I will tell the story some day By God 's Grace ( ALL GLORY TO GOD ) , doing my entrepreneurship career has gotten me recognition home and abroad including from President Obama through his Foundation , the Dutch Government , The Wharton School , Ventures Platform , Embassy of Ireland in Nigeria ... Others are Regional Universities Forum for Capacity Building in Agriculture ( RUFORUM ) - a network of 121 Vice Chancellors of African Universities , Federal Government of Nigeria , Niger Delta Development Commission ( NDDC ) ... Small and Medium Enterprises Development Agency of Nigeria ( SMEDAN ) , Embassy of France in Nigeria , Bank of Industry , African Entrepreneurship Awards , Morocco , and several others . Because of my work as an entrepreneur , I have had FREE , and I mean COMPLETELY FREE trips to some countries in Africa and Europe . It looks like I am bragging but I am actually not . There were times I applied for these things - put myself forward , pushed and pushed and I always got a NO ! For me to share one award , recognition or free travel that came my way , I may have gotten NOs in a multiple of 10 , if not 20 . There is a particular annual fellowship I have applied for every year from inception back to back for 6 times in 6 years . I will try again the 7th time this year and look forward to being selected . That is how it is . You have to develop a thick skin to getting NOs , see them as part of the process and forge ahead . You have to learn from your mistakes and pick up yourself quickly . You have to ultimately look for your own lane and run your race . Do not let anyone guilt trip you in believing that this life is a competition . We are not wired to do the same things . You also have to stay HUMBLE . Little accolades should not get to your head . If it does , your dreams are so small . Increase the elasticity . That does not mean you will not celebrate your wins . Celebrate them . Enjoy them . But you know what , move on quickly and do the same things you were doing even more . I HAVE MY STORY ! YOU HAVE YOURS ! They are never the same even though our results might be similar . It could even bring us plenty money and fame . But it is never the same . Finally , success is not even about the money and the fame alone . It is about living your life in a way that you feel happy and fulfilled . Only that , money makes the happiness and fulfillment sweeter . Just find your lane , stay there and run your race . Dazzol . Blessed weekend ."	0

Let ´ s help fight the spread of the coronavirus . Let ´ s protect ourselves , our loved ones , colleagues , friends , the community and our country . So here ´ s a thread of Q & A on coronaviruses ( COVID - 19 ) from World Health Organization . #CovidfreeApril #CovidfreePhilippines #CovidfreeWorld Some people become infected but do n't develop any symptoms and do n't feel unwell . Most people ( about 80 % ) recover from the disease without needing special treatment . Around 1 out of every 6 people who gets COVID - 19 becomes seriously ill and develops difficulty breathing . 2/3 Older people , and those with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure , heart problems or diabetes , are more likely to develop serious illness . People with fever , cough and difficulty breathing should seek medical attention . 3/3 How does COVID - 19 spread ? People can catch COVID - 19 from others who have the virus . The disease can spread from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth which are spread when a person with COVID - 19 coughs or exhales . 1/3 These droplets land on objects and surfaces around the person . Other people then catch COVID - 19 by touching these objects or surfaces , then touching their eyes , nose or mouth . 2/3 People can also catch COVID - 19 if they breathe in droplets from a person with COVID - 19 who coughs out or exhales droplets . This is why it is important to stay more than 1 meter ( 3 feet ) away from a person who is sick . 3/3 Can the virus that causes COVID - 19 be transmitted through the air ? Studies to date suggest that the virus that causes COVID - 19 is mainly transmitted through contact with respiratory droplets rather than through the air . Can CoVID - 19 be caught from a person who has no symptoms ? The main way the disease spreads is through respiratory droplets expelled by someone who is coughing . The risk of catching COVID - 19 from someone with no symptoms at all is very low . 1/2 However , many people with COVID - 19 experience only mild symptoms . This is particularly true at the early stages of the disease . It is therefore possible to catch COVID - 19 from someone who has , for example , just a mild cough and does not feel ill . 2/2	0

1 . Is it safe to receive a letter or a package from China ? Yes , it is safe . People receiving packages from China are not at risk of contracting the new coronavirus . From previous analysis , we know coronaviruses do not survive long on objects , such as letters or packages . 2 . Can spraying alcohol or chlorine all over your body kill the new coronavirus ? No . Spraying alcohol or chlorine on your body will not kill viruses that have already entered your body . Rather , spraying such substances can be harmful to clothes or mucous membranes ( eyes , mouth ) . 3 . How effective are thermal scanners in detecting people infected with the new coronavirus ? Thermal scanners are effective in detecting people who have developed a fever because of infection . However , they can not detect people who are infected but are not yet sick with fever . 4 . Can an ultraviolet disinfection lamp kill the new coronavirus ? UV lamps should not be used to sterilize hands or other areas of skin as UV radiation can cause skin irritation . 5 . Are hand dryers effective in killing the new coronavirus ? No . Hand dryers are not effective in killing the new coronavirus . To protect yourself against the new coronavirus , you should frequently clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap & water . 6 . Can pets at home spread the new coronavirus ( 2019 - nCoV ) ? At present , there is no evidence that companion animals / pets such as dogs or cats can be infected with the new coronavirus . However , it is always a good idea to wash your hands with soap & water after contact with pets . 7 . Do vaccines against pneumonia protect you against the new coronavirus ? No . Vaccines against pneumonia offer no protection against the new coronavirus . The virus is so new and different that it needs its own vaccine . Researchers are trying to develop one & WHO is in support . 8 . Does the new coronavirus affect older people , or are younger people also susceptible ? People of all ages can be infected by the new coronavirus but older people & those with pre-existing medical conditions ( such as asthma , diabetes , etc . ) appear to be more vulnerable . WHO advises people of all ages to take steps to protect themselves from the virus , for example by following good hand hygiene and good respiratory hygiene . 9 . Are antibiotics effective in preventing and treating the new coronavirus ? No , antibiotics do not work against viruses , only bacteria . The new coronavirus ( 2019 - nCoV ) is a virus and , therefore , antibiotics should not be used as a means of prevention or treatment . 10 . Are there any specific medicines to prevent or treat the new coronavirus ? To date , there is no specific medicine recommended to prevent or treat the new coronavirus . However , those infected with the virus are receiving appropriate care to relieve and treat symptoms .	0

I 've read a lot about Corona virus lately and I think I should share some highlights of the good read . It 's a #Thread , and in form of Q & A . What is a coronavirus ? Coronavirus is a large family of viruses which may cause illness in animals or humans . In humans , several coronaviruses are known to cause respiratory infections ranging from common cold to MERS & SARS . The most recently discovered coronavirus is COVID - 19 . What is COVID - 19 ? COVID - 19 is the INFECTIOUS disease caused by the most recently discovered coronavirus . This new virus and disease were unknown before the outbreak began in Wuhan , China , in December 2019 . The most common symptoms of COVID - 19 are fever , tiredness , & dry cough . Some patients may have aches & pains , nasal congestion , runny nose , sore throat or diarrhea . These symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually . Some people become infected but do n't develop any symptoms . Older people , and those with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure , heart problems or diabetes , are more likely to develop serious illness . People with fever , cough and difficulty breathing should seek medical attention . How does COVID - 19 spread ? People can catch COVID - 19 from others who have the virus . The disease can spread from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth which are spread when a person with COVID - 19 coughs or exhales . How likely am I to catch COVID - 19 ? The risk depends on where you are - and more specifically , whether there is a COVID - 19 outbreak unfolding there . Should I worry about COVID - 19 ? Although illness due to COVID - 19 infection is generally mild , especially for children and young adults . It is still quite normal for people to worry about how the COVID - 19 outbreak will affect them and their loved ones . Are antibiotics effective in preventing or treating the COVID - 19 ? No . Antibiotics do not work against viruses , they only work on bacterial infections . COVID - 19 is caused by a virus , so antibiotics do not work . Is there a vaccine , drug or treatment for COVID - 19 ? Not yet . To date , there is no vaccine and no specific antiviral medicine to prevent or treat COVID - 2019 . However , those affected should receive care to relieve symptoms . People with serious illness should be hospitalized . Is COVID - 19 the same as SARS ? No . The virus that causes COVID - 19 and the one that causes Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome ( SARS ) are related to each other genetically , but they are different . SARS is MORE DEADLY but much less infectious than COVID - 19 . Should I wear a mask to protect myself ? Only wear a mask if you are ill with COVID - 19 symptoms ( especially coughing ) or looking after someone who may have COVID - 19 . The mask can only be used once . If you are not ill / looking after someone who is ill then you are WASTING a mask . Can I catch COVID - 19 from my pet ? No . There is no evidence that companion animals or pets such as cats and dogs have been infected or could spread the virus that causes COVID - 19 . Is there anything I should not do ? The following measures ARE NOT effective against COVID - 2019 and can be harmful : 1 . Smoking 2 . Taking traditional herbal remedies 3 . Wearing multiple masks 4 . Taking self-medication such as antibiotics . In any case , if you have fever , cough and difficulty breathing seek medical care early to reduce the risk of developing a more severe infection and be sure to share your recent travel history with your health care provider . #CoronaAlert #coronavirus #CoronaOutbreak #Thread	0

Part 16 What can I do to protect myself and prevent the spread of disease ? Protection measures for everyone Stay aware of the latest information on the COVID - 19 outbreak , available on the WHO website and through your national and local public health authority . #FREDIBOAT Part 17 Many countries around the world have seen cases of COVID - 19 and several have seen outbreaks . Authorities in China and some other countries have succeeded in slowing or stopping their outbreaks . However , the situation is unpredictable so check regularly #FREDIBOAT for the latest news . Part 18 You can reduce your chances of being infected or spreading COVID - 19 by taking some simple precautions : Regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water . Why ? Washing your hands with #FREDIBOAT Part 19 droplets from their nose or mouth which may contain virus . If you are too close , you can breathe in the droplets , including the COVID - 19 virus if the person coughing has the disease . Avoid touching eyes , nose and mouth . Why ? Hands touch many #FREDIBOAT Part 20 surfaces and can pick up viruses . Once contaminated , hands can transfer the virus to your eyes , nose or mouth . From there , the virus can enter your body and can make you sick . Make sure you , and the people around you , follow good respiratory hygiene . #FREDIBOAT Part 21 This means covering your mouth and nose with your bent elbow or tissue when you cough or sneeze . Then dispose of the used tissue immediately . Why ? Droplets spread virus . By following good respiratory hygiene you protect the people around you from viruses such as Part 22 cold , flu and COVID - 19 . Stay home if you feel unwell . If you have a fever , cough and difficulty breathing , seek medical attention and call in advance . Follow the directions of your local health authority . Why ? National and local authorities will #FREDIBOAT Part 23 have the most up to date information on the situation in your area . Calling in advance will allow your health care provider to quickly direct you to the right health facility . This will also protect you and help prevent spread of viruses and other infections . #FREDIBOAT Part 24 Keep up to date on the latest COVID - 19 hotspots ( cities or local areas where COVID - 19 is spreading widely ) . If possible , avoid traveling to places – especially if you are an older person or have diabetes , heart or lung disease . Why ? #FREDIBOAT Part 25 You have a higher chance of catching COVID - 19 in one of these areas . * * * Protection measures for persons who are in or have recently visited ( past 14 days ) areas where COVID - 19 is spreading Follow the guidance outlined above ( Protection measures for #FREDIBOAT Part 26 everyone ) Self-isolate by staying at home if you begin to feel unwell , even with mild symptoms such as headache , low grade fever ( 37.3 C or above ) and slight runny nose , until you recover . If it is essential for you to have someone bring you supplies or #FREDIBOAT Part 27 to go out , e . g . to buy food , then wear a mask to avoid infecting other people . Why ? Avoiding contact with others and visits to medical facilities will allow these facilities to operate more effectively and help protect you and others from possible COVID - 19 #FREDIBOAT Part 28 and other viruses . If you develop fever , cough and difficulty breathing , seek medical advice promptly as this may be due to a respiratory infection or other serious condition . Call in advance and tell your provider of any recent travel or contact with travelers . Part 28 Why ? Calling in advance will allow your health care provider to quickly direct you to the right health facility . This will also help to prevent possible spread of COVID - 19 and other viruses . #FREDIBOAT Part 29 How likely am I to catch COVID - 19 ? The risk depends on where you are - and more specifically , whether there is a COVID - 19 outbreak unfolding there . For most people in most locations the risk of catching COVID - 19 is still low . However , there are now places around Part 30 the world ( cities or areas ) where the disease is spreading . For people living in , or visiting , these areas the risk of catching COVID - 19 is higher . Governments and health authorities are taking vigorous action every time a new case of COVID - 19 is identified . Be sure to Part 31 comply with any local restrictions on travel , movement or large gatherings . Cooperating with disease control efforts will reduce your risk of catching or spreading COVID - 19 . COVID - 19 outbreaks can be contained and transmission stopped , as has been shown in #FREDIBOAT Part 32 China and some other countries . Unfortunately , new outbreaks can emerge rapidly . It 's important to be aware of the situation where you are or intend to go . WHO publishes daily updates on the COVID - 19 situation worldwide . You can see these at HTTPURL	0

HOW DOES COVID - 19 SPREAD ? :sneezing_face: People can catch COVID - 19 from others who have the virus . :sweat_droplets: The disease can spread from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth which are spread when a person with COVID - 19 coughs or exhales . :spoon: These droplets land on objects and surfaces around the person . :backhand_index_pointing_left: Other people then catch COVID - 19 by touching these objects or surfaces , then touching their eyes , nose or mouth . :left-right_arrow: People can also catch COVID - 19 if they breathe in droplets from a person with COVID - 19 who coughs out or exhales droplets . This is why it is important to stay more than 1 meter ( 3 feet ) away from a person who is sick . WHO is assessing ongoing research on the ways COVID - 19 is spread and will continue to share updated findings . Can the virus that causes COVID - 19 be transmitted through the air ? Studies to date suggest that the virus that causes COVID - 19 is mainly transmitted through contact with respiratory droplets rather than through the air . Can COVID - 19 be caught from a person who has no symptoms ? The main way the disease spreads is through respiratory droplets expelled by someone who is coughing . The risk of catching COVID - 19 from someone with no symptoms at all is very low . However , many people with COVID - 19 experience only mild symptoms . This is particularly true at the early stages of the disease . It is therefore possible to catch COVID - 19 from someone who has , for example , just a mild cough and does not feel ill . #WHOWhatsapp	0

If it 's not , then contact is needed to contract it . If we take precautionary hygiene actions , it will help reduce it 's spread . I 'd like incoming travel to stop temporarily .

In the race to stop the spread of COVID - 19 , some are wondering if #HerdImmunity is the answer . But what is that exactly ? Here 's what things look like now : HTTPURL Here 's what that looks like : HTTPURL For this to work , 70 percent of the population would need to have immunity . That 's 229,767 , 666 people in the U . S . alone . HTTPURL Scientists reached this threshold by figuring out how infectious COVID - 19 is specifically . This is called R0 value . It measures how many people an infected person is likely to infect . This is how COVID - 19 ' s R0 values compare to other diseases . HTTPURL Even though the numbers are high and it may seem simple at first glance , most scientists are n't onboard with relying on #HerdImmunity . Why ? This tactic would take between 1 million - 2 million deaths in the U . S . and 30 million around the world . That 's millions too many . HTTPURL Until a vaccine can provide widespread immunity , communities need to prioritize keeping case numbers low and manageable , especially heading into the fall , when more activities will have to move indoors and the flu season will add more strain . The alternative would be devastating . Experts also noted that by social distancing , we can mimic this tactic . Staying six feet away from others also prevents the virus from bouncing to a new person .

The risk of catching COVID - 19 from someone with no symptoms at all is very low . Bisakah tertular CoVID - 19 dari orang yang tidak memiliki gejala ? Cara utama penyebaran penyakit ini adalah melalui percikan / droplet yang dikeluarkan oleh seseorang yang batuk . Risiko terkena COVID - 19 dari seseorang tanpa gejala sama sekali sangat rendah . However , many people with COVID - 19 experience only mild symptoms . This is particularly true at the early stages of the disease . It is therefore possible to catch COVID - 19 from someone who has , for example , just a mild cough and does not feel ill . Namun , banyak orang dengan COVID - 19 hanya mengalami gejala ringan . Ini sebenarnya pada tahap awal penyakit . Karena itu dimungkinkan untuk tertular COVID - 19 dari seseorang yang , misalnya , hanya batuk ringan dan tidak merasa sakit .	0

Part 9 Can the virus that causes COVID - 19 be transmitted through the air ? Studies to date suggest that the virus that causes COVID - 19 is mainly transmitted through contact with respiratory droplets rather than through the air . See previous answer on “ How does COVID - 19 spread ? ” Part 10 Can CoVID - 19 be caught from a person who has no symptoms ? The main way the disease spreads is through respiratory droplets expelled by someone who is coughing . The risk of catching COVID - 19 from someone with no symptoms at all is very low . However , #FREDIBOAT Part 13 Can I catch COVID - 19 from the feces of someone with the disease ? The risk of catching COVID - 19 from the feces of an infected person appears to be low . While initial investigations suggest the virus may be present in feces in some cases , spread through this #FREDIBOAT Part 14 route is not a main feature of the outbreak . WHO is assessing ongoing research on the ways COVID - 19 is spread and will continue to share new findings . #FREDIBOAT Part 15 Because this is a risk , however , it is another reason to clean hands regularly , after using the bathroom and before eating #FREDIBOAT Part 16 What can I do to protect myself and prevent the spread of disease ? Protection measures for everyone Stay aware of the latest information on the COVID - 19 outbreak , available on the WHO website and through your national and local public health authority . #FREDIBOAT Part 17 Many countries around the world have seen cases of COVID - 19 and several have seen outbreaks . Authorities in China and some other countries have succeeded in slowing or stopping their outbreaks . However , the situation is unpredictable so check regularly #FREDIBOAT for the latest news . Part 18 You can reduce your chances of being infected or spreading COVID - 19 by taking some simple precautions : Regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water . Why ? Washing your hands with #FREDIBOAT Part 19 droplets from their nose or mouth which may contain virus . If you are too close , you can breathe in the droplets , including the COVID - 19 virus if the person coughing has the disease . Avoid touching eyes , nose and mouth . Why ? Hands touch many #FREDIBOAT Part 20 surfaces and can pick up viruses . Once contaminated , hands can transfer the virus to your eyes , nose or mouth . From there , the virus can enter your body and can make you sick . Make sure you , and the people around you , follow good respiratory hygiene . #FREDIBOAT Part 21 This means covering your mouth and nose with your bent elbow or tissue when you cough or sneeze . Then dispose of the used tissue immediately . Why ? Droplets spread virus . By following good respiratory hygiene you protect the people around you from viruses such as Part 22 cold , flu and COVID - 19 . Stay home if you feel unwell . If you have a fever , cough and difficulty breathing , seek medical attention and call in advance . Follow the directions of your local health authority . Why ? National and local authorities will #FREDIBOAT Part 23 have the most up to date information on the situation in your area . Calling in advance will allow your health care provider to quickly direct you to the right health facility . This will also protect you and help prevent spread of viruses and other infections . #FREDIBOAT Part 24 Keep up to date on the latest COVID - 19 hotspots ( cities or local areas where COVID - 19 is spreading widely ) . If possible , avoid traveling to places – especially if you are an older person or have diabetes , heart or lung disease . Why ? #FREDIBOAT Part 25 You have a higher chance of catching COVID - 19 in one of these areas . * * * Protection measures for persons who are in or have recently visited ( past 14 days ) areas where COVID - 19 is spreading Follow the guidance outlined above ( Protection measures for #FREDIBOAT Part 26 everyone ) Self-isolate by staying at home if you begin to feel unwell , even with mild symptoms such as headache , low grade fever ( 37.3 C or above ) and slight runny nose , until you recover . If it is essential for you to have someone bring you supplies or #FREDIBOAT Part 27 to go out , e . g . to buy food , then wear a mask to avoid infecting other people . Why ? Avoiding contact with others and visits to medical facilities will allow these facilities to operate more effectively and help protect you and others from possible COVID - 19 #FREDIBOAT Part 28 Why ? Calling in advance will allow your health care provider to quickly direct you to the right health facility . This will also help to prevent possible spread of COVID - 19 and other viruses . #FREDIBOAT Part 29 How likely am I to catch COVID - 19 ? The risk depends on where you are - and more specifically , whether there is a COVID - 19 outbreak unfolding there . For most people in most locations the risk of catching COVID - 19 is still low . However , there are now places around Part 30 the world ( cities or areas ) where the disease is spreading . For people living in , or visiting , these areas the risk of catching COVID - 19 is higher . Governments and health authorities are taking vigorous action every time a new case of COVID - 19 is identified . Be sure to Part 31 comply with any local restrictions on travel , movement or large gatherings . Cooperating with disease control efforts will reduce your risk of catching or spreading COVID - 19 . COVID - 19 outbreaks can be contained and transmission stopped , as has been shown in #FREDIBOAT Part 32 China and some other countries . Unfortunately , new outbreaks can emerge rapidly . It 's important to be aware of the situation where you are or intend to go . WHO publishes daily updates on the COVID - 19 situation worldwide . You can see these at HTTPURL	0

Just as fast as the virus has spread so has the misinformation surrounding COVID - 19 which can be equally as harmful . In this thread you 'll find many of the popular theories debunked as outlined by the @USER . 5G mobile networks DO NOT spread COVID - 19 Viruses can not travel on radio waves / mobile networks . COVID - 19 is spreading in many countries that do not have 5G mobile networks . COVID - 19 is spread through respiratoatry droplets when an infected person coughs , sneezes or speaks . Exposing yourself to the sun or to temperatures higher than 25C degrees DOES NOT prevent the coronavirus disease ( COVID - 19 ) Evidenced by the surge here at home you can catch COVID - 19 , no matter how sunny or hot the weather is . Countries with hot weather have had numerous cases . The new coronavirus CANNOT be transmitted through mosquito bites . To date there has been no information nor evidence to suggest that the new coronavirus could be transmitted by mosquitoes . Black People Can Get Corona . Data on race and the virus is too limited to draw sweeping conclusions , but disparate rates of sickness and death have emerged in some places . COVID - 19 is infecting and killing black people in the US at disproportionately high rates . @USER	0

You preheat the oven to a certain temperature , do n't be surprised when shit gets cooked . “ It 's crazy how expensive insurance premiums have become and how healthcare has become tied to employment . ” When we treat healthcare like a commodity to be bought and sold where third parties can make trillions , how could we expect the result to be anything other than this ? “ So the only option we have is a hard reopen of the economy in the middle of a pandemic ? ” When you have an economy that was built to favor those with generational wealth largely on the backs of those who were n't allowed to create it and no real social safety net ... I guess so .	0

What is “ a Coronavirus shutdown ” and how is it proved ? @USER I was initially “ yes , at fucking last some assistance ” , but now I 'm not so sure . It now seems like it could be a load of hurdles ( wages cover ) , and effectively a 0 % loan ( VAT deferral ) which is n't nothing , but does n't seem super useful in the absence of a economic expansion .

"So people assume how many remain susceptible can be estimated by subtracting those with positive antibodies ( serology ) from the total . Is this consistent with what is being observed ? #COVID19 9 / x A ubiquitous assumption made is , that at the start , all in the population are susceptible if exposed to a new virus such as SAR-CoV - 2 . But is this assumption always correct ? #COVID19 7 / x As a pandemic evolves , the susceptible are consider to be those that remain after one excludes those infected and recovered . It is difficult to precisely determine at a given time who is infected because of the dynamic nature of the disease . #COVID19 8/ x Most serologic assays have ranged from 1-3 % all the way up to 20-30 % in areas such as New York City . And the curve seems to be ending in NYC . What gives ? #COVID19 10 / x Similarly , in a recent study of an isolated Alpine community in Austria shows that even in a close-knit community only a fraction of people became infected . #COVID19 11 / x HTTPURL It seems the pandemic has stopped in that community , with a high antibody prevalence of 42.4 % . Notably , children were less likely to be infected . #COVID19 12 / x In another study , it was also shown that children are less likely to be infected , with a hypothesis being that this is driven by lower expression of the ACE 2 receptor . #COVID19 13 / x HTTPURL Another fascinating study of a ship expedition to the Antarctic showed that even in close proximity a significant faction of people did not become infected . H / T @USER #COVID19 14 / x HTTPURL So it seems likely we can not estimate the fraction of susceptible individuals by merely determining this by the lack of specific SAR-COV - 2 protective antibodies . #COVID19 15 / x How could this be ? Is it possible not all are likely to be infected ? I suspect this is multifactorial and mostly hypothetical . I will share two possibilities others have explored . #COVID19 16 / x The most likely explanation is that there are some mechanisms that have evolved over the course of human / primates / mammal evolution and that there is some possibility of cross-immunity derived from other coronaviruses . #COVID19 17 / x This is hard to prove but it is possible that evolution has selected traits making humans more resilient to coronaviruses exposure . Perhaps our ancestors or even lemurs already had major existential threats in the past ! Thank you ! #COVID19 18 / x HTTPURL HTTPURL How could we be protected ? It is impossible to tell . Our knowledge about coronaviruses is limited as is true for most science . Maybe polymorphisms in receptors , immunity , or other ways . We might never know . But we do know evolutionary pathways select #COVID19 19 / x Another possibility is cross-reactivity to other coronaviruses . One such study has shown that as a possibility . They found T cell reactivity from viable T cells stored before SARS-CoV - 2 . In nearly one-half of cases ! #COVID19 20 / x HTTPURL This study was small but very provocative . If confirmed , this means that these individuals with such reactivity would need to be subtracted from the "" S "" ( as in susceptible ) . In other words , you can be functionally "" immune "" even if not exposed #COVID19 21 / x HTTPURL Importantly , and somewhat obvious , they will not have typical SAR-CoV - 2 antibodies . But they may still have protective cross-reactive antibodies against other coronaviruses . #COVID19 22 / x It would be fascinating to test for such immunity and antibodies in close contacts of infected individuals who did not become sick . Low hanging fruit ! #COVID19 23 / x HTTPURL Modern science has the capability of presenting an array of targets ( proteome ) of coronaviruses to test for the presence of these antibodies . #COVID19 24 / x It is possible a high viral dose can overcome some level of cross-immunity . That would explain why there are clusters among families or friends . And also some of the cases reported in healthcare workers . #COVID19 25 / x Globally we have heard from colleagues in Peru , Ecuador and Greece saying “ the parking lots were full , we had no more beds . They are gone ” #COVID19 26 / x The problem is we have no reliable way of knowing who is susceptible , and how is not . I do not recommend anyone reads this as a way to relax our safety measures . But hopefully this give you hope . #COVID19 27 / x @USER highly recommends I read the A Camus book . Highly descriptive of the current situation . #COVID19 28 / x In the meantime stay safe , use masks in public , quarantine yourself if ill . And remain hopeful . #COVID19 29 / x"	0

Like the pvp weapons in particular . ( It won by like 85 % in polls ) @USER Some of those actually did come , but I 'm afraid we 've got other projects to deal with too , such as today 's rather large update , and we have not promised that the requests on your survey will be enacted , let alone committed to a date . @USER Hi Ash , sorry for the direct tone I used in my tweet .

Tower thread - The fact people are going out to crowded public areas ( bars for the most part ) is mind boggling . Yes younger people ( under 55/60 ) are mildly effected for the most part ( unless you have a preexisting illness ) . But any age is still just as contagious as the next . You can have COVID - 19 and not show a single symptom . Then go visit your grandparent / parent and pass to them who will a more serious chance of being effected from a health standpoint . So many people are so uneducated on COVID - 19 . Yes the media has completely overblown this . But , sporting events , concerts , Disney are all closed for a reason . COVID - 19 is just like the flu . Realistically we will all eventually get this , just like we have all had the flu before . But this is a new virus that needs to be slowed down for our medical field to catch up . The only way to allow the medical field to catch up is SOCIAL DISTANCE yourself . If you do not social distance yourself then the virus will spread rapidly ( e . i . China & Italy ) causing medical facilities to max out with people left waiting with COVID - 19 that may or may not be in a critical condition . On top of that that , it 's the fact if we let this spread and facilities fill up , then you have the scenarios of a heart attack victim not being about to have the services needed due to the facilities being maxed out . It 's not a beat it , it 's a slow it down . As young people in society it 's our duty to slow this virus down . Avoid social gatherings , avoid large crowds , wash your fucking hands , wipe down machines at the gym , socially distance yourself . If you have mindset of “ I 'm young , and this really does n't effect me ” , then not only are you being selfish but you 're the route cause for spreading . In 2 weeks , the people out in public crowds now are going to be the same people complaining when all nonessential companies ( medical , emergency , food sources ) are closed for 3 weeks to try and control all @USER this .	1

Open the country NOW @USER @USER I hope you are right . I want this over . I can't take it anymore . We are being scammed . @USER In Brazil this information is coming from blood banks , which test every donation . In Rio de Janeiro the antibody rate went from 4 % in April to 14 % in May , and 28 % in the beginning of June . In the US the Red Cross should certainly have this info . Why is n't it available ? @USER Antibody tests are important if for no other reason , they still do n't know how long the antibodies last and / or resist reinfection . No one has yet to be able to answer that but I assume they are still testing to determine ? Who knows ? @USER @USER Earlier tonight there was a report that North Carolina antibody testing showed 17 % exposure implying a very low IFR which would mean the virus has fewer to infect and is not as lethal to those it does . @USER Also , vaccines are more lucrative than good old cheap common sense herd immunity . @USER @USER Why did they scream in March we need more tests . Now we are doing it and now they are like shut it down . The left gives me a headache . @USER I thought NIH was doing this ? I volunteered but apparently was not selected .. @USER Because the tyrannical idiots running the show need to take credit for herd immunity 's work . Harris County 's mask edict has just been extended until late August . By which time this would have been over any way . But now the can say "" see ! Look at what my mask edict accomplished !

I do n't think it 's that easy . In the early stages the virus is too spotty go get a grip on it for something useful . @USER Gotta make it last to November , then it will all go silent @USER @USER Remember when Birx said on April 1 , 2020 , ” there is no more flu ” . After that day any flu deaths were counted as Covid . We stupidly went along and believed anything they said . @USER What about the CDC anti body testing done in late March / early April ? @USER In the early days everyone said this can't be a hoax because the whole world is locking down . Ok . Fair . Now flip the situation : why is only the US locking down ( to this extent ) again ? :thinking_face: @USER And T-Cell immunity seems to be more widespread than antibodies . New York , Italy , etc seems to show that we 're nearing herd immunity , like it or not . @USER So what is the end game here , who is benefitting from falsely keeping us all in panic ?

Which also means if enough people get it , it will fade away completely . Just like SARS and MERS ( both coronaviruses ) @USER Elections ... @USER Meanwhile Arizona hospitals have received the go ahead to use crisis standards of care . Resources are being rationed and people are dying that could have been saved . @USER @USER That 's a great point ! @USER Ohio was supposed to have the results of theirs in May ... For some reason we are still waiting @USER A friend asked his Dr . to authorixe antibody test in Utah . Dr . said not reliable enough & would n't . @USER What 's happening in NC ? @USER Might wanna do a bit more research on antibody testing @USER @USER @USER Antibody tests that are positive for ANTIBODIES is like having your own vaccine on board . Do more testing for antibodies , viral tests when symptomatic . #COVID19 #COVID19TX @USER Yeah , be a REAL shame if herd immunity was achieved naturally before a vaccine can be rushed to market . @USER @USER NIH has been performing one . Results will be out in the next month or Two . @USER HTTPURL @USER You will never get that data . The last thing Democrats want is the true on this hoax to get out . @USER 112 n no a v @USER Because reliable tests are n't out there @USER They want us wearing bacterial-laden PETRI DISHES on our faces , to MAKE US SICK , so that in October , when we all have respiratory illnesses they can yell “ COVID ! COVID ! SEE ? ITS COVID ! NO VOTING IN PERSON ! CLOSE THE POLLS ” @USER @USER @USER Alex , be careful with antibody tests . Body deals usually so easy with the Sars COV 2 , that most of people do n't even develop antibodies . @USER @USER That 's my question ... I live in NC . @USER @USER I 'm not sure what you mean but maybe I get some of it ? I believe that there are no coincidences ever . So how is it that ALL THE EVENTS HAPPENING ARE RIGHT ON TIME ? FOR SOMETHING . HOW CAN THE VIRUS DO WHAT IT'S DOING VERY METHODICALLY AND SPECIFICALLY AT CERTAIN TIMES AND PLACES @USER Alex , what 's happening in NC ? I live here and all I hear is gloom and doom . Despite the numbers our own illustrious @USER dashboard tells us . @USER @USER So I heard someone on OAN NEWS said that the numbers of new cases are being cooked but my thought is what if it 's worse than that what if they are using MANIPULATED TEST KITS SOMEHOW IT'S SURELY POSSIBLE EVERY OTHER THING GOING ON ? @USER This graph represents HERD IMMUNITY . Is n't this what we want ? HTTPURL @USER madness , we are in the hands of luddites , cretins & #CovidiotInChief @USER @USER Airlines are ( obv ) businesses & they have been working on a committee with the President to get back to opening up our country . Fireworks at the state level xcld bc some Govs dont want happiness & prosperity or anything positive happening that would help Trump get re-elected . @USER I think you are gonna be right . Or close . But the evidence will be , I think , on Worldometer or similar . Deaths for sure are WAY down . Let 's see if the cases graph falls like a rock soon . I hope so . @USER Posting this again . This seems to be correct . HTTPURL @USER And this : HTTPURL @USER Did you see this study from Karolina ka in Sweden suggestion antibody testing may be understating the infection and immunity rates because many people do n't produce antibodies but produce an effective T cell immune response ? HTTPURL @USER New York City antibody results were over 20 % two months ago . I would expect that they are much higher now , but there has been silence on that issue . @USER Assuming 20 % positive on NYC antibody test , that would mean a potential of 2 million positive test results from NYC alone . @USER My guess is the real antibody results in NYC are much higher , which is good news , not bad news , of course , because it leads to herd immunity . @USER It 's even more fundamental . "" Novo "" Wuhan virus found in waste water samples in Spain - in early 2019 . The whole Fauci narrative was BS from Day One . The deaths are seasonal , predictable and many are the result of malpractice HTTPURL @USER @USER Of course , they can manage to produce tests that over report positives by 50 % but not antibody testing . It 's like the media wants to propagate the scam , as if they have a motive to harm the leader of the country 's popularity or something . @USER It 's irrelevant because by Fall the daily deaths rate will be approaching zero . They wo n't be able to hide that glaring fact . @USER I suspected long ago that this would be very slow in coming , since it endangers the narrative . @USER We will not see a widespread , accurate antibody test because each person who tests positive is one less customer for a vaccine shot . @USER The CDC has shown itself to be another incompetent , self perpetuating Government bureaucracy . Random Covid 19 testing should have started in January 2020 . Without random testing you have no idea of what 's happening . The CDC is clueless . @USER The CDC says for every 1 case we identified , there were at least 10 we did n't . Fauci claimed yesterday the US would see 100,000 cases per day . Do the math . We have been well over his number for some time . We are now identifying those by testing people who are n't ill . @USER And two months ago they said that 's what needed to happen , more testing to identify and isolate cases and those people with no symptoms . Now they are saying that 's bad bad because , well that 's a lot of cases . I feel like we are being punked . @USER Nefarious ? They want this to continue ? Or incompetence ? @USER @USER Pharmaceutical industrial complex @USER So let 's just let it spread and we will find out . @USER HTTPURL has FDA EUA approved Covid - 19 antibody tests available for immediate delivery to approved government and healthcare facilities ! This will help identify those with antibodies ! @USER Come on @USER why are you giving us this information ? @USER Antibody tests are not accurate enough to base any clinical decisions around . Talk to a doctor or someone in the clinical chemistry , molecular , or microbiology field , they will tell you the same thing . @USER Um ... no . I do n't know if you noticed , but New York was a bit tense while all that was going on @USER ￼ "" New research from Karolinska Institutet and Karolinska University Hospital shows that many people with mild or asymptomatic COVID - 19 demonstrate so-called T-cell-mediated immunity to the new coronavirus , even if they have not tested positively for antibodies . "" @USER @USER Great article ! :thumbs_up: @USER Probably because they 're saying the tests are inaccurate . 🤷‍♀ @USER @USER What are you referring to in NC ? @USER They are all going to deny herd immunity until November 4 . Their followers are not exactly difficult to manipulate . NJ governor just “ paused ” indoor dining although COVID burned out here months ago . @USER Fredericksburg VA this morning my husband was talked out of antibody test by doctor because she said they 're inconclusive and pointless . @USER Confirmation for all the “ just wait two weeks ” ninnies , Karens , and NPCs . They are gonna fight hard , but keep sharing the data . Ca n't hide from the truth : HTTPURL @USER It could be that there are so many reliability problems with the antibody testing kits . @USER @USER HTTPURL @USER @USER Hey ! Dr . @USER you retweeting crazy conspiracy theories is really going to help out @USER win those center moderate voters ! Keep up the great work :thumbs_up: @USER my wife and I did our part to reduce the death rate by surviving COVID . It was n't fun but almost everyone who get it survives--including almost every person in the U . S . workforce . @USER have politicized COVID because restarting the economy helps Trump . @USER Likely adding the number of “ positive antibodies ” test results in with the “ covid positive ” results . It 's easier to fluff the numbers that way :face_with_raised_eyebrow: cause it is “ all covid ” ... @USER @USER Herd immunity will never be achieved for corona viruses . Just like it does n't exist for influenza viruses . It will or mutate and become part of life or mutate and disappear . My guess is the second one . @USER @USER Hundo p @USER @USER @USER It can't mutate and disappear , bc literally natural selection . Also Coronavirus family do n't drift antigenically with a rate remotely resembling influenza . @USER The Red Cross is now offering free antibody testing with a blood donation . Hopefully that data will be aggregated and released . @USER I 've been asking this the whole . It 's odd @USER Herd immunity would upset the plans ; mail in ballots , fear for control , vaccines for all , contact tracing which really is the ground work for "" social score "" ; most of all Marxist take over . @USER Also , I look forward to seeing this one on @USER in two weeks @USER They do n't want this to end ... anything to prolong the assault on liberties and freedom ... and anything to get rid of Trump . @USER @USER Not sure about doing things NY or Italian style . They basically euthanized the vulnerable by using nursing homes for CV19 patients . Mental midgets . @USER @USER Well you live in NY - enjoy . @USER While good news , think we 've a longer way to go to get to herd immunity . @USER Alex , what 's happening in N . C . have n't seen any stats . Their website is not much help . No actual number for hospitalization and nothing about antibodies . cc : @USER @USER @USER What is happening in NC ? A little background of truth . NC is JUST NOW starting to test Nursing Home residents and workers in the facilities . JUST now . 50 % of NC deaths are from Nursing homes . @USER Looking at the real stats . HTTPURL @USER What 's happening in NC ? What did I miss ? @USER The NC study is not randomized . These volunteers are self selected . I have n't requested an antibody test because I do n't think I have had the virus . Please stop calling it a randomized study . @USER Why is @USER not demanding this ? @USER According to these Swedish researchers antibody tests under count infected by 2x ! NYC could easily be at 60 % if they are right . HTTPURL @USER @USER Blame the idiot in chief #TrumpKillsUS @USER What is happening in NC ? @USER It 's funny seeing people talk about the ins and outs of things like herd immunity and nucleic acid / anti body test that probably never heard of any of those things 3 months ago . @USER We do n't know because the CDC is not treating this "" viral disease "" like a real emergency that requires excellent data and surveillance . They are treating it like a political bludgeon . Clear data would hamper their mission . @USER HTTPURL Another day another article . .. Now they say test for T-cells and not for antibodies . .. "" For every person testing positive for antibodies , two were found to have specific T-cells which identify and destroy infected cells . "" Do we know what to test ? @USER @USER Is that when the often mentioned T - cells come into the picture ? @USER @USER SMH . So why has n't Gov Abbott been mentioning this of late , if at all ? @USER @USER Yikes . That makes sense . But it 's so sickening in it 's sneakiness . @USER @USER @USER @USER Can someone more well informed than myself please explain to me , if it 's possible to have both T cells and antibodies present for the same pathogen ? Or do the T cells ( if present ) automatically override / cancel out the ABs ? @USER @USER @USER REALLY ? ? @USER @USER Agreed ! Vaccine is aqcuired immunity in the herd , otherwise it 's natural herd immunity . People that think vaccines are the answer , do n't realize they are actually for herd immunity . They do n't realize vaccines are not harmless , either . @USER Can you try to make these results available ?"	0

* Can I catch COVID - 19 from feces , animals , pets , surfaces or packages ? * :toilet: * Can I catch COVID - 19 from the feces of someone with the disease ? * The risk of catching COVID - 19 from the feces of an infected person appears to be low . While initial investigations suggest the virus may be present in feces in some cases , spread through this route is not a main feature of the outbreak . WHO is assessing ongoing research on the ways COVID - 19 is spread and will continue to share new findings . Because this is a risk , however , it is another reason to clean hands regularly , after using the bathroom and before eating . :paw_prints: * Can humans become infected with the COVID - 19 from an animal source ? * Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that are common in animals . Occasionally , people get infected with these viruses which may then spread to other people . For example , SARS-CoV was associated with civet cats and MERS-CoV is transmitted by dromedary camels . Possible animal sources of COVID - 19 have not yet been confirmed . To protect yourself , such as when visiting live animal markets , avoid direct contact with animals and surfaces in contact with animals . Ensure good food safety practices at all times . Handle raw meat , milk or animal organs with care to avoid contamination of uncooked foods and avoid consuming raw or undercooked animal products . :dog_face: * Can I catch COVID - 19 from my pet ? * There is no evidence that a dog , cat or any pet can transmit COVID - 19 . COVID - 19 is mainly spread through droplets produced when an infected person coughs , sneezes or speaks . To protect yourself clean your hands frequently and thoroughly .	0

However , it is always a good idea to wash your hands with soap & water after contact with pets . 5 . Are hand dryers effective in killing the new coronavirus ? No . Hand dryers are not effective in killing the new coronavirus . To protect yourself against the new coronavirus , you should frequently clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap & water . 7 .

Is Covid - 19 airborne ? The virus that causes COVID - 19 is mainly transmitted through droplets generated when an infected person coughs , sneezes , or speaks . These droplets are too heavy to hang in the air . They quickly fall on floors or surfaces . #Youth4impact #KeepAkuseSafe :exclamation_mark: HTTPURL You can be infected by breathing in the virus if you are within 1 metre of a person who has COVID - 19 , or by touching a contaminated surface and then touching your eyes , nose or mouth before washing your hands .

HOW DOES COVID - 19 SPREAD ? :sneezing_face: People can catch COVID - 19 from others who have the virus . :sweat_droplets: The disease can spread from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth which are spread when a person with COVID - 19 coughs or exhales . :spoon: These droplets land on objects and surfaces around the person . :backhand_index_pointing_left: Other people then catch COVID - 19 by touching these objects or surfaces , then touching their eyes , nose or mouth . :left-right_arrow: People can also catch COVID - 19 if they breathe in droplets from a person with COVID - 19 who coughs out or exhales droplets . This is why it is important to stay more than 1 meter ( 3 feet ) away from a person who is sick . WHO is assessing ongoing research on the ways COVID - 19 is spread and will continue to share updated findings . Can the virus that causes COVID - 19 be transmitted through the air ? Studies to date suggest that the virus that causes COVID - 19 is mainly transmitted through contact with respiratory droplets rather than through the air . Can COVID - 19 be caught from a person who has no symptoms ? The main way the disease spreads is through respiratory droplets expelled by someone who is coughing . The risk of catching COVID - 19 from someone with no symptoms at all is very low . However , many people with COVID - 19 experience only mild symptoms . This is particularly true at the early stages of the disease . It is therefore possible to catch COVID - 19 from someone who has , for example , just a mild cough and does not feel ill . #WHOWhatsapp	0

Can an ultraviolet disinfection lamp kill the new coronavirus ? UV lamps should not be used to sterilize hands or other areas of skin as UV radiation can cause skin irritation . HTTPURL Can spraying alcohol or chlorine all over your body kill the new coronavirus ? No . Spraying alcohol or chlorine all over your body will not kill viruses that have already entered your body . Spraying such substances can be harmful to clothes or mucous membranes ( i . e . eyes , mouth ) . Be aware that both alcohol and chlorine can be useful to disinfect surfaces , but they need to be used under appropriate recommendations . HTTPURL Is it safe to receive a letter or a package from China ? Yes , it is safe . People receiving packages from China are not at risk of contracting the new coronavirus . From previous analysis , we know coronaviruses do not survive long on objects , such as letters or packages . HTTPURL Can pets at home spread the new coronavirus ( 2019 - nCoV ) ? At present , there is no evidence that companion animals / pets such as dogs or cats can be infected with the new coronavirus . However , it is always a good idea to wash your hands with soap and water after contact with pets . This protects you against various common bacteria such as E.coli and Salmonella that can pass between pets and humans . HTTPURL Do vaccines against pneumonia protect you against the new coronavirus ? No . Vaccines against pneumonia , such as pneumococcal vaccine and Haemophilus influenza type B ( Hib ) vaccine , do not provide protection against the new coronavirus . The virus is so new and different that it needs its own vaccine . Researchers are trying to develop a vaccine against 2019 - nCoV . Although these vaccines are not effective against 2019 - nCoV , vaccination against respiratory illnesses is highly recommended to protect your health . HTTPURL Can regularly rinsing your nose with saline help prevent infection with the new coronavirus ? No . There is no evidence that regularly rinsing the nose with saline has protected people from infection with the new coronavirus . There is some limited evidence that regularly rinsing nose with saline can help people recover more quickly from the common cold . However , regularly rinsing the nose has not been shown to prevent respiratory infections . HTTPURL Can eating garlic help prevent infection with the new coronavirus ? Garlic is a healthy food that may have some antimicrobial properties . However , there is no evidence from the current outbreak that eating garlic has protected people from the new coronavirus . HTTPURL Does putting on sesame oil block the new coronavirus from entering the body ? No . Sesame oil does not kill the new coronavirus . There are some chemical disinfectants that can kill the 2019 - nCoV on surfaces . These include bleach / chlorine-based disinfectants , either solvents , 75 % ethanol , peracetic acid and chloroform . However , they have little or no impact on the virus if you put them on the skin or under your nose . It can even be dangerous to put these chemicals on your skin . HTTPURL Does the new coronavirus affect older people , or are younger people also susceptible ? People of all ages can be infected by the new coronavirus ( 2019 - nCoV ) . Older people , and people with pre-existing medical conditions ( such as asthma , diabetes , heart disease ) appear to be more vulnerable to becoming severely ill with the virus . WHO advises people of all ages to take steps to protect themselves from the virus , for example by following good hand hygiene and good respiratory hygiene . HTTPURL Are antibiotics effective in preventing and treating the new coronavirus ? No , antibiotics do not work against viruses , only bacteria . The new coronavirus ( 2019 - nCoV ) is a virus and , therefore , antibiotics should not be used as a means of prevention or treatment . However , if you are hospitalized for the 2019 - nCoV , you may receive antibiotics because bacterial co-infection is possible . HTTPURL Are there any specific medicines to prevent or treat the new coronavirus ? To date , there is no specific medicine recommended to prevent or treat the new coronavirus ( 2019 - nCoV ) . However , those infected with the virus should receive appropriate care to relieve and treat symptoms , and those with severe illness should receive optimized supportive care . Some specific treatments are under investigation , and will be tested through clinical trials . WHO is helping to accelerate research and development efforts with a range or partners . HTTPURL	0

@USER What is your take on the pre-existing cross-immunity idea and how it affects the herd immunity number ? Some estimates suggest that 50 % or more of the population may not be susceptible at all to Covid .

Is it 30 % , 50 % , 80 % ? Brazil seems to be doing the least to suppress it , so that may be one place to watch .	0

COVID - 19 is spreading in many countries that do not have 5G mobile networks . COVID - 19 is spread through respiratory droplets when an infected person coughs , sneezes or speaks .

They also recognise that the huge improvements in contact tracing represent the justification for asking the public to surrender some of their rights . “ Successful and appropriate use of the App relies on it com - manding well-founded public trust and confidence . ” The former head of no less a famously privacy-loving body than MI5 has also stressed that success or failure of a contact tracing app relies on the State being absolutely transparent and communicative with citizens to * earn their trust * . HTTPURL HTTPURL You will be used to seeing me complain that the state is doing data protection infringing things But to be clear - I think a well designed and implemented app is necessecary and proportionate to our current circumstances My fear is that the Gov are risking that aim with secrecy And so , I find myself in the strange position of asserting that if the State has nothing to hide re it 's Corona Tracking App , it should have nothing to fear from letting everyone know all about it . @USER As you say , currently we do n't need an app to track people we meet because for most of us they 're just the people we live with .

Around 1 out of every 6 people who gets COVID - 19 becomes seriously ill and develops difficulty breathing . Older people , and those with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure , heart problems or diabetes , are more likely to develop serious illness . About 2 % of people with the disease have died . People with fever , cough and difficulty breathing should seek medical attention . Apa saja gejala COVID - 19 ?

@USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER Rupert when did you become convinced there would be a substantial seasonal effect ? Was it when lockdown releases failed to cause rebounds ( as envisaged in Paper 9 ) ? If so what else do you infer from the non-rebounds ? HTTPURL @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER Convinced ? Not convinced , I just think it 's likely . @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER But why do you think it is likely ?

If it 's taking a break why can't we book summer holidays ? @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER Even back in Feb I though it was likely to be seasonal , but I also felt unless we suppress aggressively , it wo n't make a difference : halving R to 1.5 is irrelevant if have 1M point prevalence . BUT seasonality and low R from lockdown synergise . @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER What is seasonality if not transient herd immunity ? It seems to me we do n't really understand seasonality - but we guess it 's to do with temperature , sunlight or being outdoors . Do we basically have a herd immunity threshold of 20 % antibodies in Summer , and 60 % antibods in winter ? @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER Behaviour ... hard to model . Maybe ? @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER no , seasonality is about lowering average R due to factors that will include behaviour ( less cramming together indoors ) , susceptibility ( cold nose ) , viable virus longevity in environment etc . not about antibodies ( for common cold , v . short-lived immunity may also play part ) . @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER The way I think about it , individual immunity is n't the only factor in determining the herd immunity threshold - susceptibility ( including behaviour ) is equally important or more so .

Let ´ s help fight the spread of the coronavirus . Let ´ s protect ourselves , our loved ones , colleagues , friends , the community and our country . So here ´ s a thread of Q & A on coronaviruses ( COVID - 19 ) from World Health Organization . #CovidfreeApril #CovidfreePhilippines #CovidfreeWorld Some people become infected but do n't develop any symptoms and do n't feel unwell . Most people ( about 80 % ) recover from the disease without needing special treatment . Around 1 out of every 6 people who gets COVID - 19 becomes seriously ill and develops difficulty breathing . 2/3 Older people , and those with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure , heart problems or diabetes , are more likely to develop serious illness . People with fever , cough and difficulty breathing should seek medical attention . 3/3 How does COVID - 19 spread ? People can catch COVID - 19 from others who have the virus . The disease can spread from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth which are spread when a person with COVID - 19 coughs or exhales . 1/3 These droplets land on objects and surfaces around the person . Other people then catch COVID - 19 by touching these objects or surfaces , then touching their eyes , nose or mouth . 2/3 People can also catch COVID - 19 if they breathe in droplets from a person with COVID - 19 who coughs out or exhales droplets . This is why it is important to stay more than 1 meter ( 3 feet ) away from a person who is sick . 3/3 Can the virus that causes COVID - 19 be transmitted through the air ? Studies to date suggest that the virus that causes COVID - 19 is mainly transmitted through contact with respiratory droplets rather than through the air . Can CoVID - 19 be caught from a person who has no symptoms ? The main way the disease spreads is through respiratory droplets expelled by someone who is coughing . The risk of catching COVID - 19 from someone with no symptoms at all is very low . 1/2 However , many people with COVID - 19 experience only mild symptoms . This is particularly true at the early stages of the disease . It is therefore possible to catch COVID - 19 from someone who has , for example , just a mild cough and does not feel ill . 2/2	0

COVID - 19 virus can be transmitted in areas with hot and humid climates From the evidence so far , the COVID - 19 virus can be transmitted in ALL AREAS , including areas with hot and humid weather . Actually , taking a hot bath with extremely hot water can be harmful , as it can burn you . The best way to protect yourself against COVID - 19 is by frequently cleaning your hands . By doing this you eliminate viruses that may be on your hands and avoid infection that could occur by then touching your eyes , mouth , and nose . HTTPURL The new coronavirus CANNOT be transmitted through mosquito bites . To date there has been no information nor evidence to suggest that the new coronavirus could be transmitted by mosquitoes . The new coronavirus is a respiratory virus which spreads primarily through droplets generated when an infected person coughs or sneezes , or through droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose . To protect yourself , clean your hands frequently with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water . Also , avoid close contact with anyone who is coughing and sneezing . HTTPURL Are hand dryers effective in killing the new coronavirus ? No . Hand dryers are not effective in killing the 2019 - nCoV . To protect yourself against the new coronavirus , you should frequently clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water . Once your hands are cleaned , you should dry them thoroughly by using paper towels or a warm air dryer . HTTPURL Can an ultraviolet disinfection lamp kill the new coronavirus ? UV lamps should not be used to sterilize hands or other areas of skin as UV radiation can cause skin irritation . HTTPURL How effective are thermal scanners in detecting people infected with the new coronavirus ? Thermal scanners are effective in detecting people who have developed a fever ( i . e . have a higher than normal body temperature ) because of infection with the new coronavirus . However , they can not detect people who are infected but are not yet sick with fever . This is because it takes between 2 and 10 days before people who are infected become sick and develop a fever . HTTPURL The virus is so new and different that it needs its own vaccine . Researchers are trying to develop a vaccine against 2019 - nCoV , and WHO is supporting their efforts . Although these vaccines are not effective against 2019 - nCoV , vaccination against respiratory illnesses is highly recommended to protect your health . HTTPURL Can regularly rinsing your nose with saline help prevent infection with the new coronavirus ? No . There is no evidence that regularly rinsing the nose with saline has protected people from infection with the new coronavirus . There is some limited evidence that regularly rinsing nose with saline can help people recover more quickly from the common cold . However , regularly rinsing the nose has not been shown to prevent respiratory infections . HTTPURL Can eating garlic help prevent infection with the new coronavirus ? Garlic is a healthy food that may have some antimicrobial properties . However , there is no evidence from the current outbreak that eating garlic has protected people from the new coronavirus . HTTPURL Does the new coronavirus affect older people , or are younger people also susceptible ? People of all ages can be infected by the new coronavirus ( 2019 - nCoV ) . Older people , and people with pre-existing medical conditions ( such as asthma , diabetes , heart disease ) appear to be more vulnerable to becoming severely ill with the virus . WHO advises people of all ages to take steps to protect themselves from the virus , for example by following good hand hygiene and good respiratory hygiene . HTTPURL Are antibiotics effective in preventing and treating the new coronavirus ? No , antibiotics do not work against viruses , only bacteria . The new coronavirus ( 2019 - nCoV ) is a virus and , therefore , antibiotics should not be used as a means of prevention or treatment . However , if you are hospitalized for the 2019 - nCoV , you may receive antibiotics because bacterial co-infection is possible . HTTPURL Are there any specific medicines to prevent or treat the new coronavirus ? To date , there is no specific medicine recommended to prevent or treat the new coronavirus ( 2019 - nCoV ) . However , those infected with the virus should receive appropriate care to relieve and treat symptoms , and those with severe illness should receive optimized supportive care .	0

What can I do to protect myself and prevent the spread of disease ? - Regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water . Why ? Washing with soap and water or using alcoholbased hand rub kills viruses that may be on your hands . Maintain at least 1 metre ( 3 feet ) distance between yourself and anyone who is coughing or sneezing . Why ? When someone coughs or sneezes they spray small liquid droplets from their nose or mouth which may contain virus . If you are too close , you can breathe in the droplets . - Avoid touching eyes , nose and mouth . - Make sure you , and the people around you , follow good respiratory hygiene . This means covering your mouth and nose with your bent elbow or tissue when you cough or sneeze . Then dispose of the used tissue immediately . #COVIDー19 #COVID Stay home if you feel unwell . If you have a fever , cough and difficulty breathing , seek medical attention and call in advance . Follow the directions of your local health authority . #COVIDー19 #COVID #COVID19france #COVID19france #Covid_19	0
@USER 2 / n we know that immune protection exists in animal and monkey testing upon re-exposure . However , many have used antibody titers as a test to check immune memory in the clinic . This may unfortunately not be as useful for Covid - 19 . @USER Historically it has been to do serology or blood tests for pathogen-specific antibodies . This study suggests that this may not be as useful over time . Which brings up other than live virus re-exposure tests , if there is protection , what is the best test ? again , time will tell . @USER Booster vaccine shots can be given if needed . However , we do n't know how those who 've been infected already , but then have reduced antibody levels , will respond to re-exposure . The same or different ? For those who have n't had it yet , no one wants to run that risk .	0

Can the virus that causes COVID - 19 be transmitted through the air ? Studies to date suggest that the virus that causes COVID - 19 is mainly transmitted through contact with respiratory droplets rather than through the air . How does COVID - 19 spread ? People can catch COVID - 19 from others who have the virus . The disease can spread from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth which are spread when a person with COVID - 19 coughs or exhales . These droplets land on objects and surfaces around the person . Other people then catch COVID - 19 by touching these objects or surfaces , then touching their eyes , nose or mouth . People can also catch COVID - 19 if they breathe in droplets from a person with COVID - 19 who coughs out or exhales droplets . This is why it is important to stay more than 1 meter ( 3 feet ) away from a person who is sick . World Health Organisation is assessing ongoing research on the ways COVID - 19 is spread and will continue to share updated findings . HTTPURL	0

Some patients may have aches and pains , nasal congestion , runny nose , sore throat or diarrhea . These symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually . Some people become infected but do n't develop any symptoms and do n't feel unwell . Most people ( about 80 % ) recover from the disease without needing special treatment . Around 1 out of every 6 people who gets COVID - 19 becomes seriously ill and develops difficulty breathing . Older people , and those with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure , heart problems or diabetes , are more likely to develop serious illness . People with fever , cough and difficulty breathing should seek medical attention . How does COVID - 19 spread ? People can catch COVID - 19 from others who have the virus . The disease can spread from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth which are spread when a person with COVID - 19 coughs or exhales . T These droplets land on objects and surfaces around the person . Other people then catch COVID - 19 by touching these objects or surfaces , then touching their eyes , nose or mouth . People can also catch COVID - 19 if they breathe in droplets from a person with COVID - 19 who coughs out or exhales droplets . This is why it is important to stay more than 1 meter ( 3 feet ) away from a person who is sick . WHO is assessing ongoing research on the ways COVID - 19 is spread and will continue to share updated findings .	0

Could'nt he find any doing God 's work ?

@USER @USER That 's just plain not true . We 're not declining as a whole around the country but are holding fairly steady as some states improve but others get worse . And I notice you conveniently ignored all of the data I shared providing context to your first graph . @USER @USER I did n't ignore anything . Arguing on social media solves nothing . You 'll have your opinion no matter what I share . @USER @USER The fact of the matter is the general population of 18 to 50 that is relatively healthy is going to need to be exposed to Covid . It 's called developing heard immunity . Hiding in your house from the virus like it 's a cat burglar does not work . I 'm not saying not to wear your mask . @USER @USER This is false . The vaccine will create immunity as they have for other communicable diseases . There is no need to risk people 's lives until the vaccine because you do n't like a mask . @USER @USER What is the goal of a vaccine ? You guessed it . Herd immunity ! Not everyone can take a vaccine . People used to have measle and chicken pox parties to get it over with . I 'm not saying covid is the same disease but this idea you have to hide until there 's a vaccine is moronic @USER @USER You 'd rather knowingly let people die to achieve a goal that we will achieve in 6 months without the unnecessary deaths ... WAIT FOR IT ... so you do n't have to wear a piece of cloth over your mouth sometimes ... Bless your heart . Good bye	0

What is a coronavirus ? Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses which may cause illness in animals or humans . In humans , several coronaviruses are known to cause respiratory infections ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as MERS , SARS and now , COVID - 19 . Some people become infected but do n't develop any symptoms and do n't feel unwell . Most people ( about 80 % ) recover from the disease without needing special treatment . Around 1 out of every 6 people who gets COVID - 19 becomes seriously ill and develops difficulty breathing . 2/3 Older people , and those with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure , heart problems or diabetes , are more likely to develop serious illness . People with fever , cough and difficulty breathing should seek medical attention . 3/3 How does COVID - 19 spread ? People can catch COVID - 19 from others who have the virus . The disease can spread from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth which are spread when a person with COVID - 19 coughs or exhales . 1/3 These droplets land on objects and surfaces around the person . Other people then catch COVID - 19 by touching these objects or surfaces , then touching their eyes , nose or mouth . 2/3 People can also catch COVID - 19 if they breathe in droplets from a person with COVID - 19 who coughs out or exhales droplets . This is why it is important to stay more than 1 meter ( 3 feet ) away from a person who is sick . 3/3 Can the virus that causes COVID - 19 be transmitted through the air ? Studies to date suggest that the virus that causes COVID - 19 is mainly transmitted through contact with respiratory droplets rather than through the air . Can CoVID - 19 be caught from a person who has no symptoms ? The main way the disease spreads is through respiratory droplets expelled by someone who is coughing . The risk of catching COVID - 19 from someone with no symptoms at all is very low . 1/2 However , many people with COVID - 19 experience only mild symptoms . This is particularly true at the early stages of the disease . It is therefore possible to catch COVID - 19 from someone who has , for example , just a mild cough and does not feel ill . 2/2	0
